# MTD introduction

The *Myceliophthora thermophila* Database (MTD) is a platform that collects public data on *M. thermophila*, including genomic data, transcriptomic data, basic gene information, functional annotations. Moreover, MTD integrates various predictive data that biologist may concern, such as subcellular localization, melting temperature (Tm), and transcription factor. MTD offers multiple omics retrieval methods, including single gene and gene list searches. Importantly, it provided a retrieval method based on genes clustered in KEGG pathway. In MTD, experimental condition for transcriptomic data is manually corrected to include carbon resource, culture temperature and time, enabling biologists to explore transcript differences under specific experimental conditions. Additionally, MTD offers one-stop analysis tools for omics data analysis and visualization, sequence alignment, evolutionary analysis and metabolic flux prediction with integration of transcriptome. The establishment of the MTD not only fills a gap in the integration of public data for *M. thermophila* but also provides comprehensive resources and tools for the research on this thermophilic fungus and other filamentous fungi.
