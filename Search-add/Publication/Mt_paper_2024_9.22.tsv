39048228	Characterization of a novel AA16 lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase from Thermothelomyces thermophilus and comparison of biochemical properties with an LPMO from AA9 family	Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are copper-dependent enzymes which are categorized in the CAZy database under auxiliary activities families AA9-11, 13, 14-17. Secreted by various microorganisms, they play a crucial role in carbon recycling, particularly in fungal saprotrophs. LPMOs oxidize polysaccharides through monooxygenase/peroxygenase activities and exhibit peroxidase and oxidase activities, with variations among different families. AA16, a newly identified LPMO family, is noteworthy due to limited studies on its members, thus rendering the characterization of AA16 enzymes vital for addressing controversies around their functions. This study focused on heterologous expression and biochemical study of an AA16 LPMO from Thermothelomyces thermophilus (formerly known as Myceliophthora thermophila), namely MtLPMO16A. Substrate specificity evaluation of MtLPMO16A showed oxidative cleavage of hemicellulosic substrates and no activity on cellulose, accompanied by a strong oxidase activity. A comparative analysis with an LPMO from AA9 family explored correlations between these families, while MtLPMO16A was shown to boost the activity of some AA9 family LPMOs. The results offer new insights into the AA16 family's action mode and microbial hemicellulose decomposition mechanisms in nature.

37977536	Laccase-mediated degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in historically contaminated soil	Laccases (EC1.10.3.2) have attracted growing attention in bioremediation research due to their high reactivity and substrate versatility. In this study, three genes for potential novel laccases were identified in an enrichment culture from contaminated field soil and recombinantly expressed in E. coli. Two of them, designated as PlL and BaL, were biochemically characterized regarding their optimal pH and temperature, kinetic parameters, and substrate versatility. In addition, lacasse PlL from Parvibaculum lavamentivorans was tested on historically contaminated soil. Treatment with PlL led to a significantly higher reduction of total petroleum hydrocarbons (83% w/w) compared to the microbial control (74% w/w). Hereby, PlL was especially effective in degrading hydrocarbons > C17. Their residual concentration was by 43% w/w lower than in the microbial treatment. In comparison to the laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila (MtL), PlL treatment was not significantly different for the fraction > C17 but resulted in a 30% (w/w) lower residual concentration for hydrocarbons < C18. In general, PlL can promote the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. As a consequence, it can be applied to reduce remediation time by duly achieving remediation target concentrations needed for site closure.

The C-4 arylated products were obtained under extremely mild conditions without the need for amine protection or halogenation of the substrates. From this method, 10 derivatives with moderate to good efficiency (42-94%) were prepared.		PloS one	Department of Organic Chemistry, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran.

39194835	A Treatment for Rice Straw and Its Use for Mealworm (Tenebrio molitor L.) Feeding: Effect on Insect Performance and Diet Digestibility	The development of reuse processes for plant by-products for both animal and human food offers numerous possibilities for quality-of-life improvements that align with a circular economy model. For this reason, we divided this study into two experiments. First, we designed a combined treatment consisting of laccase, ultrasound, and ascorbic acid to hydrolyze rice straw plant fibers and used the resulting feed as the basis for T. molitor diets. Second, we formulated diets with different inclusion levels (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) of rice straw and treated rice straw to assess their impact on larvae growth and diet digestibility. For each treatment, six replicates were employed: four for the growth-performance-digestibility trial and two for complementary uric acid determination tests. The combined laccase enzyme, ultrasound, and ascorbic acid treatment hydrolyzed 13.2% of the vegetable fibers. The diets containing treated rice straw resulted in higher larvae weight and a better feed conversion ratio; however, reaching 100% by-product inclusion values led to similar results between both diets. In conclusion, these treatments improve the potential of low-nutritional-value vegetable by-products as part of a T. molitor diet, opening the possibility of new methodologies for the use of recalcitrant vegetable by-products for insect rearing.

39051740	Biocatalytic Synthesis of Nitrile-Bearing All-Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters	The synthesis of all-carbon quaternary stereocenters containing nitriles is a very important and challenging subject in organic chemistry. We used a biocatalytic approach under mild conditions to obtain new derivatives of these scaffolds by oxidation of catechols by Myceliophthora thermophila laccase (Novozym 51003) to afford o-quinones and 1,4-addition of a series of carbon nucleophiles containing tertiary alkyle nitriles to these intermediates. Using this approach, alpha-cyano carbonyls bearing a quaternary stereocenter were also prepared. Finally, the yields for the prepared compounds were 72-94%.

38462117	Genomic characterization and expression profiling of the lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases AA9 family in thermophilic fungi Thermothelomyces fergusii in response to carbon source media	Enhancing enzyme activity and stability in biomass degradation can improve substrate saccharification and, increases biorefinery efficiency. For the first time, we identified 20 lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) AA9 genes in the genome of Thermothelomyces fergusii. Our results showed that TfAA9 was categorized into LPMOs1, LPMOs2, and LPMOs3 subgroups based on protein diversity. Protein- 3D structure analysis showed strong interactions between Myceliophthora thermophila AA9 proteins and 17 TfAA9 proteins. Gene ontology analysis indicated a high enrichment of cellulase activity in TfAA9 genes. KEGG pathways analysis revealed the role of TfAA9 proteins in the endohydrolysis of 1,4-beta-D-glucosidic linkages in cellulose. Numerous TfAA9s gene transcripts were up-regulated on avicel, cellobiose, and glucose, with a higher proportion on avicel. Protein concentration, endoglucanase, and cellulase activity were also boosted on avicel. However, limited fungal biomass was observed on avicel, despite the abundance of AA9 LPMOs in the T. fergusii genome. These findings expand our understanding of fungal AA9 genes and their role in lignocellulolytic degradation. The disparity between biomass and enzymatic activity suggests screening TfAA9 genes for highly active enzymes and redundant genes via heterologous expression. In short, functional characterization of these genes could contribute to improving the saccharification process of industrial raw materials.

39187522	Exploring the hidden hot world of long non-coding RNAs in thermophilic fungus using a robust computational pipeline	Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are versatile RNA molecules recently identified as key regulators of gene expression in response to environmental stress. Our primary focus in this study was to develop a robust computational pipeline for identifying structurally identical lncRNAs across replicates from publicly available bulk RNA-seq datasets. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the pipeline, we utilized the transcriptome of the thermophilic fungus Thermothelomyces thermophilus and assessed the expression pattern of lncRNAs in conjunction with Heat Shock Proteins (HSP), a well-known protein family critical for the cell's response to high temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that the identification of structurally identical transcripts among replicates in this thermophilic fungus ensures the reliability and accuracy of RNA studies, contributing to the validity of biological interpretations. Furthermore, the majority of lncRNAs exhibited a distinct expression pattern compared to HSPs. Our study contributes to advancing the understanding of the biological mechanisms comprising lncRNAs in thermophilic fungi.

38380057	Independent metabolism of oligosaccharides is the keystone of synchronous utilization of cellulose and hemicellulose in Myceliophthora	The effective utilization of cellulose and hemicellulose, the main components of plant biomass, is a key technical obstacle that needs to be overcome for the economic viability of lignocellulosic biorefineries. Here, we firstly demonstrated that the thermophilic cellulolytic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila can simultaneously utilize cellulose and hemicellulose, as evidenced by the independent uptake and intracellular metabolism of cellodextrin and xylodextrin. When plant biomass serviced as carbon source, we detected the cellodextrin and xylodextrin both in cells and in the culture medium, as well as high enzyme activities related to extracellular oligosaccharide formation and intracellular oligosaccharide hydrolysis. Sugar consumption assay revealed that in contrast to inhibitory effect of glucose on xylose and cellodextrin/xylodextrin consumption in mixed-carbon media, cellodextrin and xylodextrin were synchronously utilized in this fungus. Transcriptomic analysis also indicated simultaneous induction of the genes involved in cellodextrin and xylodextrin metabolic pathway, suggesting carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is triggered by extracellular glucose and can be eliminated by the intracellular hydrolysis and metabolism of oligosaccharides. The xylodextrin transporter MtCDT-2 was observed to preferentially transport xylobiose and tolerate high cellobiose concentrations, which helps to bypass the inhibition of xylobiose uptake. Furthermore, the expression of cellulase and hemicellulase genes was independently induced by their corresponding inducers, which enabled this strain to synchronously utilize cellulose and hemicellulose. Taken together, the data presented herein will further elucidate the degradation of plant biomass by fungi, with implications for the development of consolidated bioprocessing-based lignocellulosic biorefinery.

38122901	Carbohydrate-binding modules enhance H(2)O(2) tolerance by promoting lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase active site H(2)O(2) consumption	Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) oxidatively depolymerize recalcitrant polysaccharides, which is important for biomass conversion. The catalytic domains of many LPMOs are linked to carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) through flexible linkers, but the function of these CBMs in LPMO catalysis is not well understood. In this study, we utilized MtLPMO9L and MtLPMO9G derived from Myceliophthora thermophila to investigate the impact of CBMs on LPMO activity, with particular emphasis on their influence on H(2)O(2) tolerance. Using truncated forms of MtLPMO9G generated by removing the CBM, we found reduced substrate binding affinity and enzymatic activity. Conversely, when the CBM was fused to the C terminus of the single-domain MtLPMO9L to create MtLPMO9L-CBM, we observed a substantial improvement in substrate binding affinity, enzymatic activity, and notably, H(2)O(2) tolerance. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that the CBM fusion enhances the proximity of the active site to the substrate, thereby promoting multilocal cleavage and impacting the exposure of the copper active site to H(2)O(2). Importantly, the fusion of CBM resulted in more efficient consumption of H(2)O(2) by LPMO, leading to improved enzymatic activity and reduced auto-oxidative damage of the copper active center.

38392793	Secretome Analysis of Thermothelomyces thermophilus LMBC 162 Cultivated with Tamarindus indica Seeds Reveals CAZymes for Degradation of Lignocellulosic Biomass	The analysis of the secretome allows us to identify the proteins, especially carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), secreted by different microorganisms cultivated under different conditions. The CAZymes are divided into five classes containing different protein families. Thermothelomyces thermophilus is a thermophilic ascomycete, a source of many glycoside hydrolases and oxidative enzymes that aid in the breakdown of lignocellulosic materials. The secretome analysis of T. thermophilus LMBC 162 cultivated with submerged fermentation using tamarind seeds as a carbon source revealed 79 proteins distributed between the five diverse classes of CAZymes: 5.55% auxiliary activity (AAs); 2.58% carbohydrate esterases (CEs); 20.58% polysaccharide lyases (PLs); and 71.29% glycoside hydrolases (GHs). In the identified GH families, 54.97% are cellulolytic, 16.27% are hemicellulolytic, and 0.05 are classified as other. Furthermore, 48.74% of CAZymes have carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs). Observing the relative abundance, it is possible to state that only thirteen proteins comprise 92.19% of the identified proteins secreted and are probably the main proteins responsible for the efficient degradation of the bulk of the biomass: cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin.

39142195	Rational design on loop regions for precisely regulating flexibility of catalytic center to mitigate overoxidation of prazole sulfides by Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase	S-omeprazole and R-rabeprazole are important proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) used for treating peptic disorders. They can be biosynthesized from the corresponding sulfide catalyzed by Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs). During the development of BVMOs for target sulfoxide preparation, stereoselectivity and overoxidation degree are important factors considered most. In the present study, LnPAMO-Mu15 designed previously and TtPAMO from Thermothelomyces thermophilus showed high (S)- and (R)-configuration stereoselectivity respectively towards thioethers. TtPAMO was found to be capable of oxidating omeprazole sulfide (OPS) and rabeprazole sulfide (RPS) into R-omeprazole and R-rabeprazole respectively. However, the overoxidation issue existed and limited the application of TtPAMO in the biosynthesis of sulfoxides. The structural mechanisms for adverse stereoselectivity between LnPAMO-Mu15 and TtPAMO towards OPS and the overoxidation of OPS by TtPAMO were revealed, based on which, TtPAMO was rationally designed focused on the flexibility of loops near catalytic sites. The variant TtPAMO-S482Y was screened out with lowest overoxidation degree towards OPS and RPS due to the decreased flexibility of catalytic center than TtPAMO. The success in this study not only proved the rationality of the overoxidation mechanism proposed in this study but also provided hints for the development of BVMOs towards thioether substrate for corresponding sulfoxide preparation.

38750569	Construction of an enzyme-constrained metabolic network model for Myceliophthora thermophila using machine learning-based k(cat) data	BACKGROUND: Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) serve as effective tools for understanding cellular phenotypes and predicting engineering targets in the development of industrial strain. Enzyme-constrained genome-scale metabolic models (ecGEMs) have emerged as a valuable advancement, providing more accurate predictions and unveiling new engineering targets compared to models lacking enzyme constraints. In 2022, a stoichiometric GEM, iDL1450, was reconstructed for the industrially significant fungus Myceliophthora thermophila. To enhance the GEM's performance, an ecGEM was developed for M. thermophila in this study. RESULTS: Initially, the model iDL1450 underwent refinement and updates, resulting in a new version named iYW1475. These updates included adjustments to biomass components, correction of gene-protein-reaction (GPR) rules, and a consensus on metabolites. Subsequently, the first ecGEM for M. thermophila was constructed using machine learning-based k(cat) data predicted by TurNuP within the ECMpy framework. During the construction, three versions of ecGEMs were developed based on three distinct k(cat) collection methods, namely AutoPACMEN, DLKcat and TurNuP. After comparison, the ecGEM constructed using TurNuP-predicted k(cat) values performed better in several aspects and was selected as the definitive version of ecGEM for M. thermophila (ecMTM). Comparing ecMTM to iYW1475, the solution space was reduced and the growth simulation results more closely resembled realistic cellular phenotypes. Metabolic adjustment simulated by ecMTM revealed a trade-off between biomass yield and enzyme usage efficiency at varying glucose uptake rates. Notably, hierarchical utilization of five carbon sources derived from plant biomass hydrolysis was accurately captured and explained by ecMTM. Furthermore, based on enzyme cost considerations, ecMTM successfully predicted reported targets for metabolic engineering modification and introduced some new potential targets for chemicals produced in M. thermophila. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the incorporation of enzyme constraint to iYW1475 not only improved prediction accuracy but also broadened the model's applicability. This research demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating of machine learning-based k(cat) data in the construction of ecGEMs especially in situations where there is limited measured enzyme kinetic parameters for a specific organism.

39304049	Exploring novel potential of mycosynthesized magnetic nanoparticles for phosphatase immobilization and biological activity	Among different microbes, fungi are proficient candidates for the extracellular synthesis of iron nanoparticles. For biogenic synthesis of iron nanoparticles, a thermophilic mould Myceliophthora thermophila BJTLRMDU7 was used in this study. Mycogenic magnetic nanoparticles were used for phosphatase immobilization and therapeutic applications such as antimicrobial and antimalarial activity. Firstly, the phosphatase was immobilized on biogenic iron nanoparticles with an efficiency of >56鈥%. Immobilized enzyme was optimally active at 60鈥 degrees C and pH鈥5. Immobilized phosphatase was recycled using external magnetic field up to 4th cycle retaining >50鈥% activity. The immobilized phosphatase efficiently released inorganic phosphate from different flours such as wheat, maize and gram at 37鈥 degrees C and 60鈥 degrees C. There was continuous increase in the release of inorganic phosphorus from all samples with incubation time at 37鈥 degrees C and slight reduction at 60鈥 degrees C. These nanoparticles showed the effective antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Myceliophthora thermophila. Further, the synthesized iron nanoparticles showed antimalarial potential against Plasmodium falciparum. Biogenic nanoparticles did not exhibit hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity. Therefore, biogenic iron nanoparticles could be used as a suitable matrix for immobilization of enzymes and safe therapeutics.

38692377	Recombinant cellobiose dehydrogenase from Thermothelomyces thermophilus: Its functional characterization and applicability in cellobionic acid production	The fungus Thermothelomyces thermophilus is a thermotolerant microorganism that has been explored as a reservoir for enzymes (hydrolytic enzymes and oxidoreductases). The functional analysis of a recombinant cellobiose dehydrogenase (MtCDHB) from T. thermophilus demonstrated a thermophilic behavior, an optimal pH in alkaline conditions for inter-domain electron transfer, and catalytic activity on cellooligosaccharides with different degree of polymerization. Its applicability was evaluated to the sustainable production of cellobionic acid (CBA), a potential pharmaceutical and cosmetic ingredient rarely commercialized. Dissolving pulp was used as a disaccharide source for MtCDHB. Initially, recombinant exoglucanases (MtCBHI and MtCBHII) from T. thermophilus hydrolyzed the dissolving pulp, resulting in 87% cellobiose yield, which was subsequently converted into CBA by MtCDHB, achieving a 66% CBA yield after 24 h. These findings highlight the potential of MtCDHB as a novel approach to obtaining CBA through the bioconversion of a plant-based source.

38751167	Engineering a Carotenoid Cleavage Oxygenase for Coenzyme-Free Synthesis of Vanillin from Ferulic Acid	One-pot biosynthesis of vanillin from ferulic acid without providing energy and cofactors adds significant value to lignin waste streams. However, naturally evolved carotenoid cleavage oxygenase (CCO) with extreme catalytic conditions greatly limited the above pathway for vanillin bioproduction. Herein, CCO from Thermothelomyces thermophilus (TtCCO) was rationally engineered for achieving high catalytic activity under neutral pH conditions and was further utilized for constructing a one-pot synthesis system of vanillin with Bacillus pumilus ferulic acid decarboxylase. TtCCO with the K192N-V310G-A311T-R404N-D407F-N556A mutation (TtCCO(M3)) was gradually obtained using substrate access channel engineering, catalytic pocket engineering, and pocket charge engineering. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that reducing the site-blocking effect in the substrate access channel, enhancing affinity for substrates in the catalytic pocket, and eliminating the pocket's alkaline charge contributed to the high catalytic activity of TtCCO(M3) under neutral pH conditions. Finally, the one-pot synthesis of vanillin in our study could achieve a maximum rate of up to 6.89 +/- 0.3 mM h(-1). Therefore, our study paves the way for a one-pot biosynthetic process of transforming renewable lignin-related aromatics into valuable chemicals.	aromatic aldehydes, carotenoid cleavage oxygenase, enzyme engineering, molecular dynamics simulation, vanillin	Journal of agricultural and food chemistry	Engineering Research Center for High-Valued Utilization of Fruit Resources in Western China, Ministry of Education; National Research & Development Center of Apple Processing Technology; College of Food Engineering and Nutritional Science, Shaanxi Normal University, 620 West Changan Avenue, Xian 710119, Shaanxi, P.

38678481	Structural and molecular insights into a bifunctional glycoside hydrolase 30 xylanase specific to glucuronoxylan	"Glycoside hydrolase (GH) 30 family xylanases are enzymes of biotechnological interest due to their capacity to degrade recalcitrant hemicelluloses, such as glucuronoxylan (GX). This study focuses on a subfamily 7 GH30, TtXyn30A from Thermothelomyces thermophilus, which acts on GX in an ""endo"" and ""exo"" mode, releasing methyl-glucuronic acid branched xylooligosaccharides (XOs) and xylobiose, respectively. The crystal structure of inactive TtXyn30A in complex with 2(3)-(4-O-methyl-alpha-D-glucuronosyl)-xylotriose (UXX), along with biochemical analyses, corroborate the implication of E233, previously identified as alternative catalytic residue, in the hydrolysis of decorated xylan. At the -1 subsite, the xylose adopts a distorted conformation, indicative of the Michaelis complex of TtXyn30AEE with UXX trapped in the semi-functional active site. The most significant structural rearrangements upon substrate binding are observed at residues W127 and E233. The structures with neutral XOs, representing the ""exo"" function, clearly show the nonspecific binding at aglycon subsites, contrary to glycon sites, where the xylose molecules are accommodated via multiple interactions. Last, an unproductive ligand binding site is found at the interface between the catalytic and the secondary beta-domain which is present in all GH30 enzymes. These findings improve current understanding of the mechanism of bifunctional GH30s, with potential applications in the field of enzyme engineering."

38372925	Under explored roles of microbial ligninolytic enzymes in aerobic polychlorited biphenyl transformation	Polychlorited biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent organic pollutants in the environment that are responsible for many adverse health effects. Bioremediation appears to be a healthy and cost-effective altertive for remediating PCB-contamited environments. While some microbial species have been observed to be capable of transforming PCBs, only two different microbial pathways (rdh and bph pathways) have been described to be involved in PCB transformations. Ligninolytic enzymes have been observed or are under suspicion in some microbial PCB transformations. However, the role of these promising PCB-transforming enzymes, which are produced by fungi and some aerobic bacteria, is still unclear. The present review describes their role by identifying microbial PCB-transforming species and their reported ligninolytic enzymes whether proven or suspected to be involved in PCB transformations. There are several lines of evidence that ligninolytic enzymes are responsible for PCB transformations such as (1) the ability of purified laccases from Myceliophthora thermophila, Pycnoporus cinbarinus, Trametes versicolor, Cladosporium sp, and Coprinus cumatus to transform hydroxy-PCBs; (2) the increased production of laccases and peroxidases by many fungi in the presence of PCBs; and (3) the enhanced PCB transformation by Pseudomos stutzeri and Sinorhizobium meliloti NM after the addition of ligninolytic enzyme enhancers. However, if the involvement of ligninolytic enzymes in PCB transformation is clearly demonstrated in some fungal species, it does not seem to be implicated in all microbial species suggesting other still unknown metabolic pathways involved in PCB transformation and different from the bph and rdh pathways. Therefore, PCB transformation may involve several metabolic pathways, some involving ligninolytic enzymes, bph or rdh genes, and some still unknown, depending on the microbial species. In addition, current knowledge does not fully clarify the role of ligninolytic enzymes in PCB oxidation and dechlorition. Therefore, further studies focusing on purified ligninolytic enzymes are needed to clearly elucidate their role in PCB transformation.

38122901	Carbohydrate-binding modules enhance H(2)O(2) tolerance by promoting lytic polysaccharide monooxygese active site H(2)O(2) consumption	Lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses (LPMOs) oxidatively depolymerize recalcitrant polysaccharides, which is important for biomass conversion. The catalytic domains of many LPMOs are linked to carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) through flexible linkers, but the function of these CBMs in LPMO catalysis is not well understood.

Using truncated forms of MtLPMO9G generated by removing the CBM, we found reduced substrate binding affinity and enzymatic activity. Conversely, when the CBM was fused to the C terminus of the single-domain MtLPMO9L to create MtLPMO9L-CBM, we observed a substantial improvement in substrate binding affinity, enzymatic activity, and notably, H(2)O(2) tolerance. Furthermore, molecular dymics simulations confirmed that the CBM fusion enhances the proximity of the active site to the substrate, thereby promoting multilocal cleavage and impacting the exposure of the copper active site to H(2)O(2). Importantly, the fusion of CBM resulted in more efficient consumption of H(2)O(2) by LPMO, leading to improved enzymatic activity and reduced auto-oxidative damage of the copper active center.

38462117	Genomic characterization and expression profiling of the lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses AA9 family in thermophilic fungi Thermothelomyces fergusii in response to carbon source media	Enhancing enzyme activity and stability in biomass degradation can improve substrate saccharification and, increases biorefinery efficiency. For the first time, we identified 20 lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses (LPMOs) AA9 genes in the genome of Thermothelomyces fergusii. Our results showed that TfAA9 was categorized into LPMOs1, LPMOs2, and LPMOs3 subgroups based on protein diversity. Protein- 3D structure alysis showed strong interactions between Myceliophthora thermophila AA9 proteins and 17 TfAA9 proteins. Gene ontology alysis indicated a high enrichment of cellulase activity in TfAA9 genes. KEGG pathways alysis revealed the role of TfAA9 proteins in the endohydrolysis of 1,4-beta-D-glucosidic linkages in cellulose. Numerous TfAA9s gene transcripts were up-regulated on avicel, cellobiose, and glucose, with a higher proportion on avicel. Protein concentration, endoglucase, and cellulase activity were also boosted on avicel. However, limited fungal biomass was observed on avicel, despite the abundance of AA9 LPMOs in the T. fergusii genome. These findings expand our understanding of fungal AA9 genes and their role in lignocellulolytic degradation. The disparity between biomass and enzymatic activity suggests screening TfAA9 genes for highly active enzymes and redundant genes via heterologous expression. In short, functiol characterization of these genes could contribute to improving the saccharification process of industrial raw materials.

38298109	Rewiring metabolic flux to simultaneously improve malate production and elimite by-product succite accumulation by Myceliophthora thermophila	Although a high titre of malic acid is achieved by filamentous fungi, by-product succinic acid accumulation leads to a low yield of malic acid and is unfavourable for downstream processing. Herein, we conducted a series of metabolic rewiring strategies in a previously constructed Myceliophthora thermophila to successfully improve malate production and abolish succinic acid accumulation. First, a pyruvate carboxylase CgPYC variant with increased activity was obtained using a high-throughput system and introduced to improve malic acid synthesis. Subsequently, shifting metabolic flux to malate synthesis from mitochondrial metabolism by deleing mitochondrial carriers of pyruvate and malate, led to a 53.7% reduction in succinic acid accumulation. The acceleration of importing cytosolic succinic acid into the mitochondria for consumption further decreased succinic acid formation by 53.3%, to 2.12 g/L. Filly, the importer of succinic acid was discovered and used to elimite by-product accumulation. In total, malic acid production was increased by 26.5%, relative to the start strain JG424, to 85.23 g/L and 89.02 g/L on glucose and Avicel, respectively, in the flasks. In a 5-L fermenter, the titre of malic acid reached 182.7 g/L using glucose and 115.8 g/L using raw corncob, without any by-product accumulation. This study would accelerate the industrial production of biobased malic acid from renewable plant biomass.

38392793	Secretome Alysis of Thermothelomyces thermophilus LMBC 162 Cultivated with Tamarindus indica Seeds Reveals CAZymes for Degradation of Lignocellulosic Biomass	The alysis of the secretome allows us to identify the proteins, especially carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), secreted by different microorganisms cultivated under different conditions. The CAZymes are divided into five classes containing different protein families. Thermothelomyces thermophilus is a thermophilic ascomycete, a source of many glycoside hydrolases and oxidative enzymes that aid in the breakdown of lignocellulosic materials. The secretome alysis of T. thermophilus LMBC 162 cultivated with submerged fermentation using tamarind seeds as a carbon source revealed 79 proteins distributed between the five diverse classes of CAZymes: 5.55% auxiliary activity (AAs); 2.58% carbohydrate esterases (CEs); 20.58% polysaccharide lyases (PLs); and 71.29% glycoside hydrolases (GHs). In the identified GH families, 54.97% are cellulolytic, 16.27% are hemicellulolytic, and 0.05 are classified as other. Furthermore, 48.74% of CAZymes have carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs). Observing the relative abundance, it is possible to state that only thirteen proteins comprise 92.19% of the identified proteins secreted and are probably the main proteins responsible for the efficient degradation of the bulk of the biomass: cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin.

38456224	Effect of Salts on Laccase-Catalyzed Polymerization of Lignosulfote	Enzymatic polymerization of lignosulfote (LS) has a high potential for various applications. Here, the effect of different ions in low concentrations on enzymatic polymerization of LS was investigated, including salt solutions consisting of mono- and dicarboxylic acids, sulfate, phosphate and chloride with sodium as counter ion. LS polymerization was followed by viscometry and size exclusion (SEC) chromatography. Interestingly, there was only a small effect of ions on the activity of the laccase on standard substrate ABTS, while the effect on polymerization of LS was substantially different. The presence of acetate led to a 39% higher degree of polymerization (DP) for LS. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) revealed that the structure of the enzyme was largely uffected by the ions, while the determition of the zeta potential showed that those ions conveying higher negative surface charges onto LS particles showed lower DPs, than those not affecting the surface charge. Further, electron paramagnetic resonce (EPR) spectroscopy showed 5-times higher intensity in phenoxyl radicals for the monovalent ions compared to the divalent ones. It was concluded that the DPs of LS could be tuned in the presence of certain ions, by facilitating the interaction between the laccase substrate-binding site and the LS molecules.

37977536	Laccase-mediated degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in historically contamited soil	Laccases (EC1.10.3.2) have attracted growing attention in bioremediation research due to their high reactivity and substrate versatility. In this study, three genes for potential novel laccases were identified in an enrichment culture from contamited field soil and recombintly expressed in E. coli. Two of them, desigted as PlL and BaL, were biochemically characterized regarding their optimal pH and temperature, kinetic parameters, and substrate versatility. In addition, lacasse PlL from Parvibaculum lavamentivorans was tested on historically contamited soil. Treatment with PlL led to a significantly higher reduction of total petroleum hydrocarbons (83% w/w) compared to the microbial control (74% w/w). Hereby, PlL was especially effective in degrading hydrocarbons > C17. Their residual concentration was by 43% w/w lower than in the microbial treatment. In comparison to the laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila (MtL), PlL treatment was not significantly different for the fraction > C17 but resulted in a 30% (w/w) lower residual concentration for hydrocarbons < C18. In general, PlL can promote the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. As a consequence, it can be applied to reduce remediation time by duly achieving remediation target concentrations needed for site closure.

The safety and efficacy of the additive have been already assessed previously; however, the FEEDAP Panel could not conclude on the safety of the additive for the target species, consumers and the users due to lack of reliable data on the potential genotoxicity of the additive. In the present assessment, the applicant submitted a new in vitro mammalian cell micronucleus test. After the assessment of the data newly submitted, the FEEDAP Panel concluded that the use of the feed additive in animal nutrition under the conditions of use proposed is of no concern for target species and consumer safety. The additive is not irritant to the eyes or skin. Owing to the proteiceous ture of the active substance, the additive should be considered a respiratory sensitiser. The Panel cannot conclude on the potential of the additive to be a skin sensitiser.	Zootechnical additives, digestibility enhancers, endo-1,4-beta-d-manse, genotoxicity, safety, user	EFSA journal.

37066045	AA16 Oxidoreductases Boost Cellulose-Active AA9 Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygeses from Myceliophthora thermophila	Copper-dependent lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses (LPMOs) classified in Auxiliary Activity (AA) families are considered indispensable as synergistic partners for cellulolytic enzymes to saccharify recalcitrant lignocellulosic plant biomass. In this study, we characterized two fungal oxidoreductases from the new AA16 family. We found that MtAA16A from Myceliophthora thermophila and AA16A from Aspergillus nidulans did not catalyze the oxidative cleavage of oligo- and polysaccharides. Indeed, the MtAA16A crystal structure showed a fairly LPMO-typical histidine brace active site, but the cellulose-acting LPMO-typical flat aromatic surface parallel to the histidine brace region was lacking. Further, we showed that both AA16 proteins are able to oxidize low-molecular-weight reductants to produce H(2)O(2). The oxidase activity of the AA16s substantially boosted cellulose degradation by four AA9 LPMOs from M. thermophila (MtLPMO9s) but not by three AA9 LPMOs from Neurospora crassa (NcLPMO9s). The interplay with MtLPMO9s is explained by the H(2)O(2)-producing capability of the AA16s, which, in the presence of cellulose, allows the MtLPMO9s to optimally drive their peroxygese activity. Replacement of MtAA16A by glucose oxidase (AnGOX) with the same H(2)O(2)-producing activity could only achieve less than 50% of the boosting effect achieved by MtAA16A, and earlier MtLPMO9B ictivation (6 h) was observed. To explain these results, we hypothesized that the delivery of AA16-produced H(2)O(2) to the MtLPMO9s is facilitated by protein-protein interaction. Our findings provide new insights into the functions of copper-dependent enzymes and contribute to a further understanding of the interplay of oxidative enzymes within fungal systems to degrade lignocellulose.

36771814	Enzyme-Catalyzed Polymerization of Kraft Lignin from Eucalyptus globulus: Comparison of Bacterial and Fungal Laccases Efficacy	Kraft lignin, a side-stream from the pulp and paper industry, can be modified by laccases for the synthesis of high added-value products. This work aims to study different laccase sources, including a bacterial laccase from Streptomyces ipomoeae (SiLA) and a fungal laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila (MtL), for kraft lignin polymerization. To study the influence of some variables in these processes, a central composite design (CCD) with two continuous variables (enzyme concentration and reaction time) and three levels for each variable was used. The prediction of the behavior of the output variables (phenolic content and molecular weight of lignins) were modelled by means of response surface methodology (RSM). Moreover, characterization of lignins was performed by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and different nuclear magnetic resonce (NMR) spectroscopy techniques. In addition, antioxidant activity was also alyzed. Results showed that lignin polymerization (referring to polymerization as lower phenolic content and higher molecular weight) occurred by the action of both laccases. The enzyme concentration was the most influential variable in the lignin polymerization reaction within the range studied for SiLA laccase, while the most influential variable for MtL laccase was the reaction time. FTIR and NMR characterization alysis corroborated lignin polymerization results obtained from the RSM.	bacterial laccase, central composite design, characterization, eucalypt, fungal laccase, kraft lignin, polymerization, response surface methodology	Polymers	Forest Sciences Institute (ICIFOR-INIA), CSIC, Ctra. de la Coruna Km 7.5, 28040 Madrid, Spain.

36162644	A fatal case of pneumonia caused by Thermothelomycesthermophila	Thermothelomyces thermophila (formerly Myceliophthora thermophila) is usually found in soil and specifically compost as an environmental dematiaceous fungus. Here, we report the first case of invasive pulmory infection caused by T. thermophila in a pediatric patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. T. thermophila was serially cultured from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and sputum samples obtained from this patient with respiratory symptoms. The patient received antifungal treatment with liposomal amphotericin B (160 mg daily) and itracozole (200 mg daily) combition therapy, but she died. By the antifungal susceptibility testing, low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were observed for itracozole (MIC 0.06 mug/mL), voricozole (MIC 0.12 mug/mL), and posacozole (MIC 0.03 mug/mL) but high MIC was observed with amphotericin B (MIC 4.0 mug/mL). Since T. thermophila is usually found in the environment, it can be considered as a contamint and may cause difficulties in diagnosis. Therefore, it is necessary to confirm the potential of pathogen through repeated culture and to conduct an antifungal susceptibility testing to find a suitable antifungal agent.

36735022	Isolation of the Anti-Inflammatory Agent Myceliostatin from a Methionine-Enriched Culture of Myceliophthora thermophila ATCC 42464	Safe and effective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are needed. Meanwhile, addition of amino acids to cultures of microorganisms is likely to increase the possibility of novel secondary metabolite isolation. In the course of screening for anti-inflammatory agents using cellular lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) production, two new related compounds with the myceliothermophin structure from a methionine-enriched culture of Myceliophthora thermophila ATCC 42464 were isolated. The new compounds have an additiol methylthio group on the myceliothermophin structure and were med myceliostatins A and B. Both compounds inhibited LPS-induced NO production at nontoxic concentrations in macrophage-like mouse monocytic leukemia RAW264.7 cells. Myceliostatin B inhibited the expression of LPS-induced iNOS, IL-6, and IL-1beta and the upstream NF-kappaB activity in situ and in vitro. Filly, it was found to inhibit NF-kappaB binding to D in the reconstruction system with purified p65. Myceliostatin B also inhibited LPS-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Thus, myceliostatin B, a novel compound derived from M. thermophila, was found to be a new anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compound directly inhibiting NF-kappaB.

36238990	Structural and thermostability insights into cellobiohydrolase of a thermophilic mould Myceliophthora thermophila: in-silico studies	Cellobiohydrolase (CBH) is one of the cellulases with a wide range of industrial applications; it plays a pivotal role in cellulose hydrolysis and thus in biofuel production. The structural and thermostability alysis of a CBHII of the thermophilic mold Myceliophthora thermophila (MtCel6A) had been carried out using various in-silico approaches. The validation of 3 D model by the Ramachandran plot indicated 88.5% amino acid residues in the favoured regions. Docking alysis suggested MtCel6A to display a high affinity towards cellotetraose as compared to other substrates. The enzyme exhibited a high tolerance to the end product, cellobiose. The thermostability evaluation by molecular dymic simulations and principal component alysis confirmed its tolerance to elevated temperatures. The identified thermolabile regions could be targeted for site-directed mutagenesis in order to ameliorate thermostability further. Our experimental data published earlier confirmed the present findings of in-silico studies. The structural and functiol characteristics of MtCel6A highlighted its critical features that make it a useful biocatalyst in several industrial processes.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

36799667	Biochemical characteristics of Myceliophthora thermophila recombint beta-glucosidase (MtBgl3c) applicable in cellulose bioconversion	The GH3 beta-glucosidase gene of Myceliophthora thermophila (MtBgl3c) has been cloned and heterologously expressed in E. coli for the first time. This study highlights the important characteristics of recombint MtBgl3c (rMtBgl3c) which make it a promising candidate in industrial applications. Optimization of the production of rMtBgl3c led to 28,000 U L(-1). On purification, it has a molecular mass of  approximately 100 kDa. It is a broad substrate specific thermostable enzyme that exhibits pH and temperature optima at 5.0 and 55  degrees C, respectively. The amino acid residues Asp287 and Glu514 act as nucleophile and catalytic acid/base, respectively in the enzyme catalysis. Its low K(m) value (1.28 mM) indicates a high substrate affinity as compared to those previously reported. The rMtBgl3c displays a synergistic action with the commercial enzyme cocktail in the saccharification of sugarcane bagasse suggesting its utility in the cellulose bioconversion. Tolerance to solvents, detergents as well as glucose make this enzyme applicable in wine, detergent, paper and textile industries too.

37869709	Transcriptomic insights into the roles of the transcription factors Clr1, Clr2 and Clr4 in lignocellulose degradation of the thermophilic fungal platform Thermothelomyces thermophilus	Introduction: Thermothelomyces thermophilus, formerly known as Myceliophthora thermophila, is used in industry to produce lignocellulolytic enzymes and heterologous proteins. However, the transcriptiol network driving the expression of these proteins remains elusive. As a first step to systematically uncover this network, we investigated growth, protein secretion, and transcriptomic fingerprints of strains deficient in the cellulolytic transcriptiol regulators Clr1, Clr2, and Clr4, respectively. Methods: The genes encoding Clr1, Clr2, and Clr4 were individually deleted using split marker or the CRISPR/Cas12a technology and the resulting strains as well as the parental strain were cultivated in bioreactors under chemostat conditions using glucose as the carbon source. During steady state conditions, cellulose was added instead of glucose to study the genetic and cellular responses in all four strains to the shift in carbon source availability. Results: Notably, the clr1 and clr2 deletion strains were uble to continue to grow on cellulose, demonstrating a key role of both regulators in cellulose catabolism. Their transcriptomic fingerprints uncovered not only a lack of cellulase gene expression but also reduced expression of genes predicted to encode hemicellulases, pectises, and esterases. In contrast, the growth of the clr4 deletion strain was very similar compared to the parental strain. However, a much stronger expression of cellulases, hemicellulases, pectises, and esterases was observed. Discussion: The data gained in this study suggest that both transcriptiol regulators Clr1 and Clr2 activate the expression of genes predicted to encode cellulases as well as hemicellulases, pectises, and esterases. They further suggest that Clr1 controls the basal expression of cellulases and initiates the main lignocellulolytic response to cellulose via induction of clr2 expression. In contrast, Clr4 seems to act as a repressor of the lignocellulolytic response presumably via controlling clr2 expression. Comparative transcriptomics in all four strains revealed potentially new regulators in carbohydrate catabolism and lignocellulolytic enzyme expression that define a candidate gene list for future alyses.

37359531	Preclinical immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 RBD-based vaccine produced with the thermophilic filamentous fungal expression system Thermothelomyces heterothallica C1	INTRODUCTION: The emergency use of vaccines has been the most efficient way to control the corovirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corovirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern has reduced the efficacy of currently used vaccines. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is the main target for virus neutralizing (VN) antibodies. METHODS: A SARS-CoV-2 RBD vaccine candidate was produced in the Thermothelomyces heterothallica (formerly, Myceliophthora thermophila) C1 protein expression system and coupled to a noparticle. Immunogenicity and efficacy of this vaccine candidate was tested using the Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) infection model. RESULTS: One dose of 10-mug RBD vaccine based on SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain, coupled to a noparticle in combition with aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant, efficiently induced VN antibodies and reduced viral load and lung damage upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge infection. The VN antibodies neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern: D614G, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta. DISCUSSION: Our results support the use of the Thermothelomyces heterothallica C1 protein expression system to produce recombint vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and other virus infections to help overcome limitations associated with the use of mammalian expression system.

36602562	Laccase multi-point covalent immobilization: characterization, kinetics, and its hydrophobicity applications	Laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila was immobilized using one-point and multi-point covalent attachment on both a tive and a modified new commercial epoxy carrier (Immobead 150P). After 10 cycles of operation at pH 3.0 and temperature 70  degrees C, the multi-point covalently immobilized laccase on the modified Immobead 150P performed best in terms of immobilization characteristics, retaining 95% of its initial activity. Thermodymic parameters of thermal ictivation emphasized the positive impact of the immobilization procedure. At 50  degrees C, the immobilized and free enzyme activity levels dropped by 27 and 73%, respectively, after 48 h of incubation. The immobilized enzyme enhanced its stability in alkaline conditions, resuming 95% of its origil activity after 3 h at pH 9.0. Immobilization reduced substrate affinity because the free laccase's K(m) value was lower than that of the immobilized laccase. Filly, the application of immobilized laccase in an innovative wood treatment process was tested by grafting lauryl gallate (LG) in order to provide hydrophobic properties to the wood. The results showed a relative water contact angle of 85.7% for treated wood, whereas the control showed only 26.6%, after 4 min of contact between water and beechwood surface. KEY POINTS: * Multi-point covalent immobilization of a commercial laccase on a commercial support. * Enzymatic parameters generally improved by immobilization process. * New application of immobilized laccase: enzymatic-assisted wood hydrophobization.

37278305	Polyphenol Oxidase Products Are Priming Agents for LPMO Peroxygese Activity	Polyphenol oxidases catalyze the hydroxylation of monophenols to diphenols, which are reducing agents for lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses (LPMOs) in their degradation of cellulose. In particular, the polyphenol oxidase MtPPO7 from Myceliophthora thermophila converts lignocellulose-derived monophenols, and under the new perspective of the peroxygese reaction catalyzed by LPMOs, we aim to differentiate the role of the catalytic products of MtPPO7 in priming and fueling of LPMO activity. Exemplified by the activity of MtPPO7 towards guaiacol and by using the benchmark LPMO NcAA9C from Neurospora crassa we show that MtPPO7 catalytic products provide the initial electron for the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) but cannot provide the required reducing power for continuous fueling of the LPMO. The priming reaction is shown to occur with catalytic amounts of MtPPO7 products and those compounds do not generate substantial amounts of H(2) O(2) in situ to fuel the LPMO peroxygese activity. Reducing agents with a low propensity to generate H(2) O(2) can provide the means for controlling the LPMO catalysis through exogenous H(2) O(2) and thereby minimize any enzyme ictivation.	lytic polysaccharide monooxygese, monophenol, peroxygese, polyphenol oxidase, priming reduction	ChemSusChem	Department of Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Technical University of Denmark, Soltofts Plads 221, 2800, Kgs Lyngby, Denmark.

37445866	Production and Characterization of Cellulose nocrystals from Eucalyptus Dissolving Pulp Using Endoglucases from Myceliophthora thermophila	Endoglucase (EG) is a key enzyme during enzymatic preparation of cellulose nocrystals (CNCs). Myceliophthora thermophila is a thermophilic fungus that has thermal properties and a high secretion of endoglucases (EGs), and could serve as potential sources of EGs for the preparation of CNCs. In this work, four different GH families (GH5, GH7, GH12, and GH45) of EGs from M. thermophila were expressed and purified, and their enzymatic characteristics and feasibility of application in CNC preparation were investigated. It was shown that the MtEG5A from M. thermophila has good potential in the enzymatic preparation of CNCs using eucalyptus dissolving pulp as feedstock. It was also observed that there was a synergistic effect between the MtEG5A and other MtEGs in the preparation of CNCs, which improved the yield and properties of CNCs obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis. This study provides a reference for understanding the enzymatic characteristics of different families of EGs from M. thermophile and their potential application in nocellulose production.

37619677	Biochemical characterization of glycoside hydrolase family 31 alpha-glucosidases from Myceliophthora thermophila for alpha-glucooligosaccharide synthesis	The transglucosidase activity of GH31 alpha-glucosidases is employed to catalyze the synthesis of prebiotic isomaltooligosaccharides (IMOs) using the malt syrup prepared from starch as substrate. Continuous mining for new GH31 alpha-glucosidases with high stability and efficient transglucosidase activity is critical for enhancing the supply and quality of IMO preparations. In the present study, two alpha-glucosidases (MT31alpha1 and MT31alpha2) from Myceliophthora thermophila were explored for biochemical characterization. The optimum pH and temperature of MT31alpha1 and MT31alpha2 were determined to be pH 4.5 and 65  degrees C, and pH 6.5 and 60  degrees C, respectively. Both MT31alpha1 and MT31alpha2 were shown to be stable in the pH range of 3.0 to 10.0. MT31alpha1 displayed a high thermostability, retaining 60 % of activity after incubation for 24 h at 55  degrees C. MT31alpha1 is highly active on substrates with all types of alpha-glucosidic linkages. In contrast, MT31alpha2 showed preference for substrates with alpha-(1-->3) and alpha-(1-->4) linkages. Importantly, MT31alpha1 was able to synthesize IMOs and the conversion rate of maltose into the main functiol IMOs components reached over 40 %. Moreover, MT31alpha2 synthesizes glucooligosaccharides with (consecutive) alpha-(1-->3) linkages. Taken together, MT31alpha1 and MT31alpha2, showing distinct substrate and product specificity, hold clear potential for the synthesis of prebiotic glucooligosaccharides.

36966330	The arabinose transporter MtLat-1 is involved in hemicellulase repression as a pentose transceptor in Myceliophthora thermophila	BACKGROUND: Filamentous fungi possess an array of secreted enzymes to depolymerize the structural polysaccharide components of plant biomass. Sugar transporters play an essential role in nutrient uptake and sensing of extracellular sigl molecules to inhibit or trigger the induction of lignocellulolytic enzymes. However, the identities and functions of transceptors associated with the induction of hemicellulase genes remain elusive. RESULTS: In this study, we reveal that the L-arabinose transporter MtLat-1 is associated with repression of hemicellulase gene expression in the filamentous fungus Myceliophthora thermophila. The absence of Mtlat-1 caused a decrease in L-arabinose uptake and consumption rates. However, mycelium growth, protein production, and hemicellulolytic activities were markedly increased in a DeltaMtlat-1 mutant compared with the wild-type (WT) when grown on arabin. Comparative transcriptomic alysis showed a different expression profile in the DeltaMtlat-1 strain from that in the WT in response to arabin, and demonstrated that MtLat-1 was involved in the repression of the main hemicellulase-encoding genes. A point mutation that abolished the L-arabinose transport activity of MtLat-1 did not impact the repression of hemicellulase gene expression when the mutant protein was expressed in the DeltaMtlat-1 strain. Thus, the involvement of MtLat-1 in the expression of hemicellulase genes is independent of its transport activity. The data suggested that MtLat-1 is a transceptor that senses and transduces the molecular sigl, resulting in downstream repression of hemicellulolytic gene expression. MtAra-1 protein directly regulated the expression of Mtlat-1 by binding to its promoter region. Transcriptomic profiling indicated that the transcription factor MtAra-1 also plays an important role in expression of arabinolytic enzyme genes and L-arabinose catabolism. CONCLUSIONS: M. thermophila MtLat-1 functions as a transceptor that is involved in L-arabinose transport and sigl transduction associated with suppression of the expression of hemicellulolytic enzyme-encoding genes. The data presented in this study add to the models of the regulation of hemicellulases in filamentous fungi.

37568174	Development of the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila into glucoamylase hyperproduction system via the metabolic engineering using improved AsCas12a variants	BACKGROUND: Glucoamylase is an important enzyme for starch saccharification in the food and biofuel industries and mainly produced from mesophilic fungi such as Aspergillus and Rhizopus species. Enzymes produced from thermophilic fungi can save the fermentation energy and reduce costs as compared to the fermentation system using mesophiles. Thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila is industrially deployed fungus to produce enzymes and biobased chemicals from biomass during optimal growth at 45  degrees C. This study aimed to construct the M. thermophila platform for glucoamylase hyper-production by broadening genomic targeting range of the AsCas12a variants, identifying key candidate genes and strain engineering. RESULTS: In this study, to increase the genome targeting range, we upgraded the CRISPR-Cas12a-mediated technique by engineering two AsCas12a variants carrying the mutations S542R/K607R and S542R/K548V/N552R. Using the engineered AsCas12a variants, we deleted identified key factors involved in the glucoamylase expression and secretion in M. thermophila, including Mtstk-12, Mtap3m, Mtdsc-1 and Mtsah-2. Deletion of four targets led to more than 1.87- and 1.85-fold higher levels of secretion and glucoamylases activity compared to wild-type strain MtWT. Transcript level of the major amylolytic genes showed significantly increased in deletion mutants. The glucoamylase hyper-production strain MtGM12 was generated from our previously strain MtYM6 via genetically engineering these targets Mtstk-12, Mtap3m, Mtdsc-1 and Mtsah-2 and overexpressing Mtamy1 and Mtpga3. Total secreted protein and activities of amylolytic enzymes in the MtGM12 were about 35.6-fold and 51.9鈥55.5-fold higher than in MtWT. Transcriptiol profiling alyses revealed that the amylolytic gene expression levels were significantly up-regulated in the MtGM12 than in MtWT. More interestingly, the MtGM12 showed predomintly short and highly bulging hyphae with proliferation of rough ER and abundant mitochondria, secretion vesicles and vacuoles when culturing on starch. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that these AsCas12a variants worked well for gene deletions in M. thermophila. We successfully constructed the glucoamylase hyper-production strain of M. thermophila by the ratiol redesigning and engineering the transcriptiol regulatory and secretion pathway. This targeted engineering strategy will be very helpful to improve industrial fungal strains and promote the morphology engineering for enhanced enzyme production.

37482151	Modulation of the catalytic activity and thermostability of a thermostable GH7 endoglucase by engineering the key loop B3	The loop B3 of glycoside hydrolase family 7 (GH7) endoglucases is confined into long and short types. TtCel7 is a thermophilic GH7 endoglucase from Thermothelomyces thermophilus ATCC 42464 with a long loop B3. TtCel7 was distinct for the excellent thermostability (>30 % residual activity after 1-h incubation at 90  degrees C). The catalytic efficiency was reduced by removing the disulfide bond in loop B3 (C220A) and truncated the loop B3 (B3(cut)). However, B3(cut) exhibited improved thermostability, the remaining enzyme activity increased by 39 %-171 % compared toTtCel7 when treated at 70-90  degrees C for 1-h. Based on the alysis of molecular dymics simulation, both loops B1 and A3 of B3(cut) swing toward the catalytic center, which contributed to the reduced cleft-space and increased structure-rigidity. Conversely, the deletion of disulfide bond resulted in a reduction of structural rigidity in C220A. Through structure-directed enzyme modulation, this study has identified two structural elements that are related to the catalysis and thermostability of TtCel7. The loop B3 of TtCel7 possibly stretches the catalytic pocket, thereby increases the openness of the catalytic tunnel and enhancing flexibility for efficient catalysis. Additiolly, the disulfide bond within loop B3 serves to enhance structural stability and maintain a heightened level of activity.

37013645	The putative methyltransferase LaeA regulates mycelium growth and cellulase production in Myceliophthora thermophila	BACKGROUND: Filamentous fungi with the ability to use complex carbon sources has been developed as platforms for biochemicals production. Myceliophthora thermophila has been developed as the cell factory to produce lignocellulolytic enzymes and plant biomass-based biofuels and biochemicals in biorefinery. However, low fungal growth rate and cellulose utilization efficiency are significant barriers to the satisfactory yield and productivity of target products, which needs our further exploration and improvement. RESULTS: In this study, we comprehensively explored the roles of the putative methyltransferase LaeA in regulating mycelium growth, sugar consumption, and cellulases expression. Deletion of laeA in thermophile fungus Myceliophthora thermophila enhanced mycelium growth and glucose consumption significantly. Further exploration of LaeA regulatory network indicated that multiple growth regulatory factors (GRF) Cre-1, Grf-1, Grf-2, and Grf-3, which act as negative repressors of carbon metabolism, were regulated by LaeA in this fungus. We also determined that phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykise (PCK) is the core node of the metabolic network related to fungal vegetative growth, of which enhancement partially contributed to the elevated sugar consumption and fungal growth of mutant DeltalaeA. Noteworthily, LaeA participated in regulating the expression of cellulase genes and their transcription regulator. DeltalaeA exhibited 30.6% and 5.5% increases in the peak values of extracellular protein and endo-glucase activity, respectively, as compared to the WT strain. Furthermore, the global histone methylation assays indicated that LaeA is associated with modulating H3K9 methylation levels. The normal function of LaeA on regulating fungal physiology is dependent on methyltransferase activity. CONCLUSIONS: The research presented in this study clarified the function and elucidated the regulatory network of LaeA in the regulation of fungal growth and cellulase production, which will significantly deepen our understanding about the regulation mechanism of LaeA in filamentous fungi and provides the new strategy for improvement the fermentation properties of industrial fungal strain by metabolic engineering.

36542100	Dissecting key residues of a C4-dicarboxylic acid transporter to accelerate malate export in Myceliophthora	Efficient transporters are necessary for high concentration and purity of desired products during industrial production. In this study, we explored the mechanism of substrate transport and preference of the C4-dicarboxylic acid transporter AoMAE in the fungus Myceliophthora thermophila, and investigated the roles of 18 critical amino acid residues within this process. Among them, the residue Arg78, forming a hydrogen bond network with Arg23, Phe25, Thr74, Leu81, His82, and Glu94 to stabilize the protein conformation, is irreplaceable for the export function of AoMAE. Furthermore, varying the residue at position 100 resulted in changes to the size and shape of the substrate binding pocket, leading to alterations in transport efficiencies of both malic acid and succinic acid. We found that the mutation T100S increased malate production by 68%. Using these insights, we successfully generated an AoMAE variant with mutation T100S and deubiquitition, exhibiting an 81% increase in the selective export activity of malic acid. Simply introducing this version of AoMAE into M. thermophila wild-type strain increased production of malic acid from 1.22 to 54.88 g/L. These findings increase our understanding of the structure-function relationships of organic acid transporters and may accelerate the process of engineering dicarboxylic acid transporters with high efficiency. KEY POINTS: * This is the first systematical alysis of key residues of a malate transporter in fungi. * Protein engineering of AoMAE led to 81% increase of malate export activity. * Arg78 was essential for the normal function of AoMAE in M. thermophila. * Substitution of Thr100 affected export efficiency and substrate selectivity of AoMAE.

37178549	Construction and characterization of a Myceliophthora thermophila lytic polysaccharide monooxygese mutant S174C/A93C with improved thermostability	Lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses (LPMOs) can oxidatively cleave the glycosidic bonds of crystalline polysaccharides, providing more accessible sites for polysaccharide hydrolases and promoting efficient conversion of biomass. In order to promote industrial applications of LPMOs, the stability of an LPMO of Myceliophthora thermophila C1 (MtC1LPMO) was improved by adding disulfide bonds in this study. Firstly, the structural changes of wild-type (WT) MtC1LPMO at different temperatures were explored using molecular dymics simulations, and eight mutants were selected by combining the predicted results from Disulfide by Design (DBD), Multi agent stability prediction upon point mutations (Maestro) and Bridge disulfide (BridgeD) websites. Then, the enzymatic properties of the different mutants were determined after their expression and purification, and the mutant S174C/A93C with the highest thermal stability was obtained. The specific activities of unheated S174C/A93C and WT were 160.6 +/- 1.7 U/g and 174.8 +/- 7.5 U/g, respectively, while those of S174C/A93C and WT treated at 70  degrees C for 4 h were 77.7 +/- 3.4 U/g and 46.1 +/- 0.4 U/g, respectively. The transition midpoint temperature of S174C/A93C was 2.7  degrees C higher than that of WT. The conversion efficiency of S174C/A93C for both microcrystalline cellulose and corn straw was about 1.5 times higher than that of WT. Filly, molecular dymics simulations revealed that the introduction of disulfide bonds increased the beta-sheet content of the H1-E34 region, thus improving the rigidity of the protein. Therefore, the overall structural stability of S174C/A93C was improved, which in turn improved its thermal stability.

37348810	Consolidated bioprocessing for bioethanol production by metabolically engineered cellulolytic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila	Using cellulosic ethanol as fuel is one way to help achieve the world's decarbonization goals. However, the economics of the present technology are unfavorable, especially the cost of cellulose degradation. Here, we reprogram the thermophilic cellulosic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila to directly ferment cellulose into ethanol by mimicking the aerobic ethanol fermentation of yeast (the Crabtree effect), including optimizing the synthetic pathway, enhancing the glycolytic rate, inhibiting mitochondrial DH shuttles, and knocking out ethanol consumption pathway. The fil engineered strain produced 52.8 g/L ethanol directly from cellulose, and 39.8 g/L from corncob, without the need for any added cellulase, while the starting strain produced almost no ethanol. We also demonstrate that as the ethanol fermentation by engineered M. thermophila increases, the composition and expression of cellulases that facilitate the degradation of cellulose, especially cellobiohydrolases, changes. The simplified production process and significantly increased ethanol yield indicate that the fungal consolidated bioprocessing technology that we develop here (one-step, one-strain ethanol production) is promising for fueling sustaible carbon-neutral biomanufacturing in the future.

38029111	Highly efficient synergistic activity of an alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase for degradation of arabinoxylan in barley/wheat	"Here, an alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase (termed TtAbf62) from Thermothelomyces thermophilus is described, which efficiently removes arabinofuranosyl side chains and facilitates arabinoxylan digestion. The specific activity of TtAbf62 (179.07 U/mg) toward wheat arabinoxylan was the highest among all characterized glycoside hydrolase family 62 enzymes. TtAbf62 in combition with endoxylase and beta-xylosidase strongly promoted hydrolysis of barley and wheat. The release of reducing sugars was significantly higher for the three-enzyme combition relative to the sum of single-enzyme treatments: 85.71% for barley hydrolysis and 33.33% for wheat hydrolysis. HPLC alysis showed that TtAbf62 acted selectively on monosubstituted (C-2 or C-3) xylopyranosyl residues rather than double-substituted residues. Site-directed mutagenesis and interactiol alyses of enzyme-substrate binding structures revealed the catalytic sites of TtAbf62 formed different polysaccharide-catalytic binding modes with arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides. Our findings demonstrate a ""multienzyme cocktail"" formed by TtAbf62 with other hydrolases strongly improves the efficiency of hemicellulose conversion and increases biomass hydrolysis through synergistic interaction."	arabinoxylan, catalytic residues, enzyme synergism, site-directed mutagenesis, alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase	Frontiers in microbiology	State Key Laboratory of Animal Biotech Breeding, College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.

36691040	The Weimberg pathway: an altertive for Myceliophthora thermophila to utilize D-xylose	BACKGROUND: With D-xylose being the second most abundant sugar in ture, its conversion into products could significantly improve biomass-based process economy. There are two well-studied phosphorylative pathways for D-xylose metabolism. One is isomerase pathway mainly found in bacteria, and the other one is oxo-reductive pathway that always exists in fungi. Except for these two pathways, there are also non-phosphorylative pathways med xylose oxidative pathways and they have several advantages over traditiol phosphorylative pathways. In Myceliophthora thermophila, D-xylose can be metabolized through oxo-reductive pathway after plant biomass degradation. The survey of non-phosphorylative pathways in this filamentous fungus will offer a potential way for carbon-efficient production of fuels and chemicals using D-xylose. RESULTS: In this study, an altertive for utilization of D-xylose, the non-phosphorylative Weimberg pathway was established in M. thermophila. Growth on D-xylose of strains whose D-xylose reductase gene was disrupted, was restored after overexpression of the entire Weimberg pathway. During the construction, a tive D-xylose dehydrogese with highest activity in M. thermophila was discovered. Here, M. thermophila was also engineered to produce 1,2,4-butanetriol using D-xylose through non-phosphorylative pathway. Afterwards, transcriptome alysis revealed that the D-xylose dehydrogese gene was obviously upregulated after deletion of D-xylose reductase gene when cultured in a D-xylose medium. Besides, genes involved in growth were enriched in strains containing the Weimberg pathway. CONCLUSIONS: The Weimberg pathway was established in M. thermophila to support its growth with D-xylose being the sole carbon source. Besides, M. thermophila was engineered to produce 1,2,4-butanetriol using D-xylose through non-phosphorylative pathway. To our knowledge, this is the first report of non-phosphorylative pathway recombint in filamentous fungi, which shows great potential to convert D-xylose to valuable chemicals.	1,2,4-Butanetriol, D-Xylose, D-Xylose dehydrogese, Myceliophthora, Weimberg pathway	Biotechnology for biofuels and bioproducts	Key Laboratory of Engineering Biology for Low-carbon Manufacturing, Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tianjin, 300308, China.

37974259	Development of an efficient protein expression system in the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila	BACKGROUND: Thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila has been widely used in industrial applications due to its ability to produce various enzymes. However, the lack of an efficient protein expression system has limited its biotechnological applications. RESULTS: In this study, using a laccase gene reporting system, we developed an efficient protein expression system in M. thermophila through the selection of strong constitutive promoters, 5'UTRs and sigl peptides. The expression of the laccase was confirmed by enzyme activity assays. The results showed that the Mtpdc promoter (Ppdc) was able to drive high-level expression of the target protein in M. thermophila. Manipulation of the 5'UTR also has significant effects on protein expression and secretion. The best 5'UTR (NCA-7d) was identified. The transformant containing the laccase gene under the Mtpdc promoter, NCA-7d 5'UTR and its own sigl peptide with the highest laccase activity (1708 U/L) was obtained. In addition, the expression system was stable and could be used for the production of various proteins, including homologous proteins like MtCbh-1, MtGh5-1, MtLPMO9B, and MtEpl1, as well as a glucoamylase from Trichoderma reesei. CONCLUSIONS: An efficient protein expression system was established in M. thermophila for the production of various proteins. This study provides a valuable tool for protein production in M. thermophila and expands its potential for biotechnological applications.

37164048	Production of recombint lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses and evaluation effect of its addition into Aspergillus fumigatus var. niveus cocktail for sugarcane bagasse saccharification	Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising altertive for producing biofuels, despite its recalcitrant ture. There are microorganisms in ture capable of efficiently degrade biomass, such as the filamentous fungi. Among them, Aspergillus fumigatus var. niveus (AFUMN) has a wide variety of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), especially hydrolases, but a low number of oxidative enzymes in its genome. To confirm the enzymatic profile of this fungus, this study alyzed the secretome of AFUMN cultured in sugarcane bagasse as the sole carbon source. As expected, the secretome showed a predomince of hydrolytic enzymes compared to oxidative activity. However, it is known that hydrolytic enzymes act in synergy with oxidative proteins to efficiently degrade cellulose polymer, such as the Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygeses (LPMOs). Thus, three LPMOs from the fungus Thermothelomyces thermophilus (TtLPMO9D, TtLPMO9H, and TtLPMO9O) were selected, heterologous expressed in Aspergillus nidulans, purified, and used to supplement the AFUMN secretome to evaluate their effect on the saccharification of sugarcane bagasse. The saccharification assay was carried out using different concentrations of AFUMN secretome supplemented with recombint T. thermophilus LPMOs, as well as ascorbic acid as reducing agent for oxidative enzymes. Through a statistic design created by Design-Expert software, we were able to alyze a possible cooperative effect between these components. The results indicated that, in general, the addition of TtLPMO9D and ascorbic acid did not favor the conversion process in this study, while TtLPMO9O had a highly significant cooperative effect in bagasse saccharification compared to the control using only AFUMN secretome.

37354337	Trichoderma longibrachiatum and thermothelomyces thermophilus co-culture: improvement the saccharification profile of different sugarcane bagasse varieties	OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present work was to perform the co-culture between Trichoderma longibrachiatum LMBC 172, a mesophilic fungus, with Thermothelomyces thermophilus LMBC 162, a thermophilic fungus, by submerged fermentation in a bioreactor. RESULTS: There was an increase in protein production, reaching the value of 35.60 +/- 3.76 microg/ml at 72 h. An increase in the amount of proteins of 27.5% in relation to the isolated cultivation of T. longibrachiatum and 19.7% in comparison when T. thermophilus was isolated and cultivated. After that, the saccharification profile of three varieties of sugarcane (sugarcane in tura, culms of sugarcane SP80-3280, and culms of Energy cane) submitted in two pretreatments (autohydrolysis and chemical) was performed. The (e) chemical pretreatment was the better in generating of fermentable sugars from sugarcane bagasse and culms of Energy cane, while with the autohydrolysis pretreatment was obtained the better values to culms of SP80-3280 sugarcane. The sugars found were glucose, xylose, arabinose, and cellobiose. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the co-culture between these microorganisms has the potential to produce an enzymatic cocktail with high performance in the hydrolysis of materials from the sugar-alcohol industry.

We demonstrate that TthCDHIIa is thermostable in different ionic solutions and is capable of oxidizing multiple mono and oligosaccharide substrates and to continuously produce H(2)O(2). Kinetics measurements depict the enzyme catalytic characteristics consistent with an Ascomycota class II CDH. Our structural alyses show that TthCDHIIa substrate binding pocket is spacious enough to accommodate larger cello and xylooligosaccharides. We also reveal that TthCDHIIa supplemented with cellobiose reduces the viability of S. aureus ATCC 25923 up to 32 % in a planktonic growth model and also inhibits its biofilm growth on 62.5 %. Furthermore, TthCDHIIa eradicates preformed S. aureus biofilms via H(2)O(2) oxidative degradation of the biofilm matrix, making these bacteria considerably more susceptible to gentamicin and tetracycline.

The additive under assessment, tupulse(R) TS/TS L, does not pose any safety concern regarding the production strain. The FEEDAP Panel concluded that the additive is tolerated by chickens for fattening, and this conclusion can be extrapolated to all poultry for fattening. Due to the lack of reliable data regarding the potential of the additive to induce chromosomal damage, the FEEDAP Panel cannot conclude on the safety of the additive for the target species and on the safety for consumer. The use of the additive in animal nutrition is considered safe for the environment. The additive is considered not to be irritant to the skin and eyes but is considered a respiratory sensitiser, although exposure by inhalation is unlikely. The Panel could not conclude on the potential of the additive to be a skin sensitiser. Due to the lack of reliable data, the FEEDAP Panel considered that a potential of the additive to induce chromosomal damage in exposed unprotected users cannot be excluded. Consequently, exposure of users should be minimised. The Panel concluded that the additive tupulse(R) TS/TS L has the potential to be efficacious in chickens for fattening at the proposed conditions of use and this conclusion can be extrapolated to turkeys for fattening, minor poultry species for fattening and ormental birds.	tupulse(R), digestibility enhancers, efficacy, endo-1,4-beta-d-manse, poultry, safety, zootechnical additives	EFSA journal.

Therefore, cost-effective vaccine technologies that can quickly adapt to newly emerged strains are desirable. (2) The filamentous fungal host Thermothelomyces heterothallica C1 (C1, formerly Myceliophthora thermophila) offers a highly efficient and cost-effective altertive to reliably produce immunogens of vaccine quality at large scale. (3) We showed the utility of the C1 system expressing hemagglutinin (HA) and a HA fusion protein from different H1N1 influenza A virus strains. Mice vaccited with the C1-derived HA proteins elicited anti-HA immune responses similar, or stronger than mice vaccited with HA products derived from prototypical expression systems. A challenge study demonstrated that vaccited mice were protected against the aggressive homologous viral challenge. (4) The C1 expression system is proposed as part of a set of protein expression systems for plug-and-play vaccine manufacturing platforms. Upon the emergence of pathogens of concern these platforms could serve as a quick solution for producing enough vaccines for immunizing the world population in a much shorter time and more affordably than is possible with current platforms.

35757805	Modifying Surface Charges of a Thermophilic Laccase Toward Improving Activity and Stability in Ionic Liquid	The multicopper oxidase enzyme laccase holds great potential to be used for biological lignin valorization alongside a biocompatible ionic liquid (IL). However, the IL concentrations required for biomass pretreatment severely inhibit laccase activity. Due to their ability to function in extreme conditions, many thermophilic enzymes have found use in industrial applications. The thermophilic fungal laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila was found to retain high levels of activity in the IL [C(2)C(1)Im][EtSO(4)], making it a desirable biocatalyst to be used for lignin valorization. In contrast to [C(2)C(1)Im][EtSO(4)], the biocompatibility of [C(2)C(1)Im][OAC] with the laccase was markedly lower. Severe inhibition of laccase activity was observed in 15% [C(2)C(1)Im][OAc]. In this study, the enzyme surface charges were modified via acetylation, succinylation, cationization, or neutralization. However, these modifications did not show significant improvement in laccase activity or stability in [C(2)C(1)Im][OAc]. Docking simulations show that the IL docks close to the T1 catalytic copper, likely interfering with substrate binding. Although additiol docking locations for [OAc](-) are observed after making enzyme modifications, it does not appear that these locations play a role in the inhibition of enzyme activity. The results of this study could guide future enzyme engineering efforts by showing that the inhibition mechanism of [C(2)C(1)Im][OAc] toward M. thermophila laccase is likely not dependent upon the IL interacting with the enzyme surface.	docking simulation, ionic liquid, lignin, lignin degrading enzymes, surface modifacation	Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology	Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, United States.

35450635	Extending the diversity of Myceliophthora thermophila LPMOs: Two different xyloglucan cleavage profiles	"Lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses (LPMOs) play a key role in enzymatic conversion of plant cell wall polysaccharides. Continuous discovery and functiol characterization of LPMOs highly contribute to the tailor-made design and improvement of hydrolytic-activity based enzyme cocktails. In this context, a new MtLPMO9F was characterized for its substrate (xyloglucan) specificity, and MtLPMO9H was further delineated. Aided by sodium borodeuteride reduction and hydrophilic interaction chromatography coupled to mass spectrometric alysis, we found that both MtLPMOs released predomitely C4-oxidized, and C4/C6-double oxidized xylogluco-oligosaccharides. Further characterization showed that MtLPMO9F, having a short active site segment 1 and a long active site segment 2 ((-)Seg1(+)Seg2), followed a ""substitution-intolerant"" xyloglucan cleavage profile, while for MtLPMO9H ((+)Seg1(-)Seg2) a ""substitution-tolerant"" profile was found. The here characterized xyloglucan specificity and substitution (in)tolerance of MtLPMO9F and MtLPMO9H were as predicted according to our previously published phylogenetic grouping of AA9 LPMOs based on structural active site segment configurations."

35205873	Engineered Fungus Thermothelomyces thermophilus Producing Plant Storage Proteins	An efficient Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation based on the plant biry vector pPZP-RCS2 was carried out for the multiple heterologous protein production in filamentous fungus Thermothelomyces&nbsp;thermophilus F-859 (formerly Myceliophthora&nbsp;thermophila F-859). The engineered fungus Th.&nbsp;thermophilus was able to produce plant storage proteins of Zea&nbsp;mays (alpha-zein Z19) and Amaranthus&nbsp;hypochondriacus (albumin A1) to enrich fungal biomass by valuable nutritiol proteins and improved amino acid content. The mR levels of z19 and a1 genes were significantly dependent on their driving promoters: the promoter of tryptophan synthase (PtrpC) was more efficient to express a1, while the promoter of translation elongation factor (Ptef) provided much higher levels of z19 transcript abundance. In general, the total recombint proteins and amino acid contents were higher in the Ptef-containing clones. This work describes a new strategy to improve mycoprotein nutritive value by overexpression of plant storage proteins.

35056890	Evaluation of Antibacterial and Antifungal Properties of Low Molecular Weight Chitosan Extracted from Hermetia illucens Relative to Crab Chitosan	This study shows the research on the depolymerisation of insect and crab chitosans using novel enzymes. Enzyme preparations containing recombint chitise Chi 418 from Trichoderma harzianum, chitise Chi 403, and chitosase Chi 402 from Myceliophthora thermophila, all belonging to the family GH18 of glycosyl hydrolases, were used to depolymerise a biopolymer, resulting in a range of chitosans with average molecular weights (M(w)) of 6-21 kDa. The depolymerised chitosans obtained from crustaceans and insects were studied, and their antibacterial and antifungal properties were evaluated. The results proved the significance of the chitosan's origin, showing the potential of Hermetia illucens as a new source of low molecular weight chitosan with an improved biological activity.

The origil and mutant viruses escape host inte (Interferon) immunity and adaptive (Antibody) immunity, emphasizing unmet needs for high-yield, commercial-scale manufacturing to produce inexpensive vaccines/boosters for global/equitable distribution. We developed DYAI-100A85, a SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) subunit antigen vaccine expressed in genetically modified thermophilic filamentous fungus, Thermothelomyces heterothallica C1, and secreted at high levels into fermentation medium. The RBD-C-tag antigen strongly binds ACE2 receptors in vitro. Alhydrogel((R))'85'-adjuvanted RDB-C-tag-based vaccine candidate (DYAI-100A85) demonstrates strong immunogenicity, and antiviral efficacy, including in vivo protection against lethal intrasal SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) challenge in human ACE2-transgenic mice. No loss of body weight or adverse events occurred. DYAI-100A85 also demonstrates excellent safety profile in repeat-dose GLP toxicity study. In summary, subcutaneous prime/boost DYAI-100A85 inoculation induces high titers of RBD-specific neutralizing antibodies and protection of hACE2-transgenic mice against lethal challenge with SARS-CoV-2. Given its demonstrated safety, efficacy, and low production cost, vaccine candidate DYAI-100 received regulatory approval to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial to demonstrate its safety and efficacy in humans.

36567332	Diarylation of thiazolopyrimidines by laccase and their in vitro evaluation as antitumor agents	A mild and efficient method was developed for the synthesis of new derivatives of thiazolo[3,2-a] pyrimidin-3(2H)-ones from available starting materials based on the oxidation of catechols to ortho-quinone by Myceliophthora thermophila laccase (Novozym 51,003) and 1,4-addition of active methylene carbon to these in situ generated intermediates in moderate to good yields (35-93%). The structure of the products was confirmed through (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, HMBC, HSQC, DEPT-135, and mass spectroscopy techniques. These novel compounds were evaluated as active antitumor agents against human colorectal adenocarcinoma and liver adenocarcinoma cell lines. All compounds displayed potent inhibition activities against the HT-29 cell line with IC(50) values of 9.8-35.9 microM, superior to the positive control doxorubicin, and most showed potent anticancer activities against the HepG2 cell line.

34010094	Biochemical properties of cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes from Sporotrichum thermophile and their utility in bioethanol production using rice straw	Production of cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes by Sporotrichum thermophile was enhanced using response surface methodology in solid-state fermentation (SSF) using wheat straw and cotton oil cake. Cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes were partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatographic techniques. Xylase of S. thermophile is neutral xylase displaying optimal activity at 60  degrees C with K(m) and V(max) values of 0.2 mg/mL and 238.05 micromole/min, respectively. All cellulases produced by the thermophilic mold showed optimal activity at pH 5.0 and 60  degrees C with K(m) values of 0.312 mg/mL, 0.113 mg/mL, and 0.285 mM for carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase), filter paper cellulase (FPase), and beta-glucosidase, respectively and while V(max) values were 181.81, 138.88, and 66.67 micromole/min, respectively. The presence of various metal ions (Ca(2+) and Co(2+)), chemical reagent (glutaraldehyde), and surfactants (Tween 80 and Triton X-100) significantly improved the activities of all enzymes. All the enzymes showed high storage stability under low temperature (-20 and 4  degrees C) conditions. Cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes resulted in enhanced liberation of reducing sugars (356.34 mg/g) by hydrolyzing both cellulosic and hemicellulosic fractions of ammonia-pretreated rice straw as compared to other pretreatment methods used in the study. Fermentation of enzymatic hydrolysate resulted in the formation of 28.88 and 27.18 g/L of bioethanol in separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) process by Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia stipitis, respectively. Therefore, cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes of S. thermophile exhibited ideal properties of biocatalysts useful in the saccharification of cellulosic and hemicellulosic fractions of rice straw for the production of bioethanol.

33413029	Structural aspects of beta-glucosidase of Myceliophthora thermophila (MtBgl3c) by homology modelling and molecular docking	Cellulases are the enzymes with diverse range of industrial applications. Cellulases degrade cellulose into monomeric glucose units by hydrolysing beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds. There are three components of cellulases: a) endoglucase, b) exoglucase and c) beta-glucosidase which act synergistically in cellulose bioconversion. The cellulases are the third largest industrial enzymes with a great potential in bioethanol production. In this investigation, a beta-glucosidase of a thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila (MtBgl3c) was alysed for its structural characterization using in silico approaches. The protein structure of MtBgl3c is unknown, therefore an attempt has been made to model 3D structure using Modeller 9.23 software. The MtBgl3c protein model generated was validated from Verify 3D and ERRAT scores of 89.37% and 71.25%, respectively derived from SAVES. Using RAMPAGE the Ramachandran plot was generated, which predicted the accuracy of the 3D model with 91.5% amino acid residues in the favored region. The ion binding and N-glycosylation sites were also predicted. The generated model was docked with cellobiose to predict the most favorable binding sites of MtBgl3c. The key amino acid residues involved in cellobiose bonding are Val88, Asp106, Asp287, Tyr255, Arg170, Glu514. The catalytic conserved amino residues of MtBgl3c were identified. The dock score of cellobiose with MtBgl3c is much lower (-6.46 kcal/mol) than that of glucose (-5.61 kcal/mol), suggesting its high affinity for cellobiose. The docking data of MtBgl3c with glucose illustrate its tolerance to glucose. The present study provides insight into structural characteristics of the MtBgl3c which can be further validated by experimental data.

36506193	Identification of Thermostable Xylose Reductase from Thermothelomyces thermophilus: A Biochemical Characterization Approach to Meet Biofuel Challenges	The constant rise in energy demands, costs, and concerns about global warming has created a demand for new renewable altertive fuels that can be produced sustaibly. Lignocellulose biomass can act as an excellent energy source and various value-added compounds like xylitol. In this research study, we have explored the xylose reductase that was obtained from the genome of a thermophilic fungus Thermothelomyces thermophilus while searching for an enzyme to convert xylose to xylitol at higher temperatures. The recombint thermostable TtXR histidine-tagged fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and successfully purified for the first time. Further, it was characterized for its function and novel structure at varying temperatures and pH. The enzyme showed maximal activity at 7.0 pH and favored 鈥痙-xylose over other pentoses and hexoses. Biophysical approaches such as ultraviolet-visible (UV-visible), fluorescence spectrometry, and far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy were used to investigate the structural integrity of pure TtXR. This research highlights the potential application of uncharacterized xylose reductase as an alterte source for the effective utilization of lignocellulose in fermentation industries at elevated temperatures. Moreover, this research would give environment-friendly and long-term value-added products, like xylitol, from lignocellulosic feedstock for both scientific and commercial purposes.

36546909	Enzymatic Oxidation of Ferulic Acid as a Way of Preparing New Derivatives	The ferulic acid (FA)-oxidation by Myceliophthora thermophila laccase was performed in phosphate buffer at 30  degrees C and pH 7.5 as an eco-friendly procedure. LC-MS alysis showed that oxidation products were four dehydrodimers (P1, P2, P3, P5) at MM = 386 g/mol, two dehydrotetramers (P6, P7) at MM = 770 g/mol and one decarboxylated dehydrodimer (P4) at MM = 340 g/mol. Structural characterization showed that FA-dehydrodimers were symmetric for P1 and P5 while asymmetric for P2, P3 and P4. Physicochemical characterization showed that oxidation products presented a higher lipophilicity than that of FA. Moreover, symmetric dimers and tetra dimers had a higher melting point compared to FA and its asymmetric dimers. Antioxidant and anti-proliferative assessments indicated that enzymatic oligomerization increased antioxidant and anti-proliferative properties of oxidation products for P2, P3 and P6 compared to FA. Filly, this enzymatic process in water could produce new molecules, having good antiradical and anti-proliferative activities.

34155677	Green synthesis of glyco-phenol by enzymatic coupling between ferulic acid and glucosamine: An ecofriendly procedure	A new glyco-phenol was produced by the coupling between glucosamine (Glu) and ferulic acid (FA) using Myceliophthora thermophila laccase as biocatalyst in mild conditions (distilled water and 30 degrees C) as an environmentally friendly process. Results indicated that the enzymatic reaction created a new derivative (FA-Glu), produced from coupling between Glu and FA by covalent bonds. By the high production of (FA-Glu) derivative and its stability, the optimal ratio of (FA:Glu) was of (1:1) at optimal time reaction of 6 h. Under these optimal conditions, almost 55% of -NH(2) groups on Glu were bound with FA oxidation products. The new derivative showed higher hydrophobic character than Glu due to the presence of FA in its structure. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry alysis showed that (FA-Glu) derivative exhibited a molecular mass at MM 713 g/mol containing one Glu molecule and three FA molecules after decarboxylation. Furthermore, the new derivative presented good antioxidant and antiproliferative activities in comparison with Glu and FA. These results suggest that the enzymatic conjugation between Glu and FA is a promising process to produce a new glyco-phenol having good functiol properties for potential applications.	ferulic acid, functiol properties, glucosamine, glyco-phenol, laccase	Biotechnology and applied biochemistry	Laboratory of Biomolecules Engineering (LIBio), Lorraine University, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France.

High accuracy was shown in predictions related to carbon and nitrogen source utilization based on data obtained from Biolog experiments. Besides, metabolism profiles were alyzed using iDL1450 integrated with transcriptomics data of M. thermophila at various growth temperatures. The refined model provides new insights into thermophilic fungi metabolism and sheds light on model-driven strain design to improve biotechnological applications of this thermophilic lignocellulosic fungus.

36165620	MtTRC-1, a Novel Transcription Factor, Regulates Cellulase Production via Directly Modulating the Genes Expression of the Mthac-1 and Mtcbh-1 in Myceliophthora thermophila	The thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila has been used to produce industrial enzymes and biobased chemicals. In saprotrophic fungi, the mechanisms regulating cellulase production have been studied, which revealed the involvement of multiple transcription factors. However, in M. thermophila, the transcription factors influencing cellulase gene expression and secretion remain largely unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized a novel cellulase regulator (MtTRC-1) in M. thermophila through a combition of functiol genomics and genetic alyses. Deletion of Mttrc-1 resulted in significantly decreased cellulase production and activities. Transcriptome alysis revealed downregulation of not only the encoding genes of main cellulases but also the transcriptiol regulator MtHAC-1 of UPR pathway after disruption of MtTRC-1 under cellulolytic induction conditions. Herein, we also characterized the ortholog of the yeast HAC1p in M. thermophila. We show that Mthac-1 mR undergoes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced splicing by removing a 23-nucleotide (nt) intron. Notably, the protein secretion on cellulose was dramatically impaired by the deletion of MtHAC-1. Moreover, the colonial growth on various carbon sources was defective in the absence of MtHAC-1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays verified MtTRC-1 regulates the transcription of Mthac-1 and the major cellulase gene Mtcbh-1 by binding directly to the promoters in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Dse I footprinting assays identified the putative consensus binding site (5'-GNG/C-3'). These results revealed the importance of MtTRC-1 for positively regulating cellulase production. This finding has clarified the complex regulatory pathways involved in cellulolytic enzyme production. IMPORTANCE In the present study, we characterized a novel regulator MtTRC-1 in M. thermophila, which regulated cellulase production through direct transcriptiol regulation of the Mthac-1 and Mtcbh-1 genes. Our data demonstrated that MtHAC-1 is a key factor for the cellulase secretion capacity of M. thermophila. Our data indicate that this thermophilic fungus regulates cellulase production through a multilevels network, in which the protein secretory pathway is modulated by MtHAC-1-dependent UPR pathway and the cellulase gene expression is directly regulated in parallel by transcription factors. The conservation of Mttrc1 in filamentous fungi suggests this mechanism may be exploited to engineer filamentous fungal cell factories capable of producing proteins on an industrial scale.

35608343	Development of an Efficient C-to-T Base-Editing System and Its Application to Cellulase Transcription Factor Precise Engineering in Thermophilic Fungus Myceliophthora thermophila	Myceliophthora thermophila is a thermophilic fungus with great potential in biorefineries and biotechnology. The base editor is an upgraded version of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-dependent genome-editing tool that introduces precise point mutations without causing D double-strand breaks (DSBs) and has been used in various organisms but rarely in filamentous fungi, especially thermophilic filamentous fungi. Here, for the first time, we constructed three cytosine base editors (CBEs) in M. thermophila, mely, evolved apolipoprotein B mR-editing enzyme catalytic subunit 1 (APOBEC1) cytosine base editor 4 max (Mtevo-BE4max), bacteriophage Mu Gam protein cytosine base editor 4 max (MtGAM-BE4max), and evolved CDA1 deamise cytosine base editor (Mtevo-CDA1), and efficiently ictivated genes by precisely converting three codons (CAA, CAG, and CGA) into stop codons without DSB formation. The Mtevo-CDA1 editor with up to 92.6% editing efficiency is a more suitable tool for cytosine base editing in thermophilic fungi. To investigate the function of each motif of the cellulase transcription factor M. thermophila CLR-2 (MtCLR-2), we used the Mtevo-CDA1 editor. The fungal-specific motif of MtCLR-2 was found to be strongly involved in cellulase secretion, conidium formation, hyphal branching, and colony formation. Mutation of the fungus-specific motif caused significant defects in these characteristics. Thus, we developed an efficient thermophilic fungus-compatible base-editing system that could also be used for genetic engineering in other relevant filamentous fungi. IMPORTANCE A CRISPR/Cas-based base-editing approach has been developed to introduce point mutations without inducing double-strand breaks (DSBs) and attracted substantial academic and industrial interest. Our study developed the deamise-cytosine base-editing system to efficiently edit three target genes, amdS, cre-1, and the essential cellulase regulator gene Mtclr-2, in Myceliophthora thermophila. A variety of point mutations in the target loci of the D-binding domain and fungus-specific motif of M. thermophila CLR-2 (MtCLR-2) were successfully generated via our base editor Mtevo-CDA1 to elucidate its function. Here, we show that the D-binding domain of MtCLR-2 is important for the fungal response to cellulose conditions, while its fungus-specific motif is involved in fungal growth. These findings indicate that our base editor can be an effective tool for elucidating the functions of motifs of target genes in filamentous fungi and for metabolic engineering in the field of synthetic biology.

36174898	Deciphering the efficient cellulose degradation by the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila focused on the synergistic action of glycoside hydrolases and lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses	The thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila as an efficient decomposer secretes various glycoside hydrolases and auxiliary oxidation enzymes to deconstruct cellulose. However, the core enzymes critical for efficient cellulose degradation and their interactions with other cellulolytic enzymes remain unclear. Herein, the transcriptomic alysis of M. thermophila grown on Avicel exhibited that cellulases from GH5_5, GH6 and GH7, and lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses (LPMOs) from AA9 contributed to cellulose degradation. Moreover, the peptide mass fingerprinting alysis of major extracellular proteins and corresponding gene-knockout strains studies revealed that MtCel7A and MtCel5A were the core cellulolytic enzymes. Furthermore, synergistic experiments found that hydrolytic efficiencies of MtCel7A and MtCel5A were both improved by mixture C1/C4 oxidizing MtLPMO9H, but inhibited by C1 oxidizing MtLPMO9E and C4 oxidizing MtLPMO9J respectively. These results demonstrated the potential application of C1/C4 oxidizing LPMOs for future designing novel cellulolytic enzyme cocktails on the efficient conversion of cellulose into biofuels and biochemicals.

34921331	Development of a flow cytometry-based plating-free system for strain engineering in industrial fungi	Recent technical advances regarding filamentous fungi have accelerated the engineering of fungal-based production and benefited basic science. However, challenges still remain and limit the speed of fungal applications. For example, high-throughput technologies tailored to filamentous fungi are not yet commonly available for genetic modification. The currently used fungal genetic manipulations are time-consuming and laborious. Here, we developed a flow cytometry-based plating-free system to directly screen and isolate the transformed protoplasts in industrial fungi Myceliophthora thermophila and Aspergillus niger. This system combines genetic engineering via the 2A peptide and the CRISPR-Cas9 system, strain screening by flow cytometry, and direct sorting of colonies for deep-well-plate incubation and phenotypic alysis while avoiding culturing transformed protoplasts in plates, colony picking, conidiation, and cultivation. As a proof of concept, we successfully applied this system to generate the glucoamylase-hyperproducing strains MtYM6 and AnLM3 in M. thermophila and A. niger, respectively. Notably, the protein secretion level and enzyme activities in MtYM6 were 17.3- and 25.1-fold higher than in the host strain. Overall, these findings suggest that the flow cytometry-based plating-free system can be a convenient and efficient tool for strain engineering in fungal biotechnology. We expect this system to facilitate improvements of filamentous fungal strains for industrial applications. KEY POINTS: * Development of a flow cytometry-based plating-free (FCPF) system is presented. * Application of FCPF system in M. thermophila and A. niger for glucoamylase platform. * Hyper-produced strains MtYM6 and AnLM3 for glucoamylase production are generated.

36686237	Breeding of a thermostable xylase-producing strain of Myceliophthora thermophila by atmospheric room temperature plasma (ARTP) mutagenesis	Introduction: Hemicellulose is an important component in lignocellulose materials, which is second only to cellulose, accounting for 15%-35% of the dry weight of plants. In the current situation of energy shortage, making full use of lignocellulose materials to produce fuel ethanol has become an important way to solve the energy problem. Xylase plays a crucial role in the utilization of hemicellulose. It is a necessary means to reduce the cost of hemicellulose utilization by improving the activity of xylase. Moreover, most turally xylases are mesophilic enzymes, which limits their industrial application. Methods:In this study, Myceliophthora thermophila was used to produce xylases and a thermostable mutant M 2103 was obtained by atmospheric room temperature plasma (ARTP) mutagenesis. The research work started with exploring the effects of ARTP mutagenesis on the antioxidase system [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), and antioxidant capacity (AOC)] of M. thermophile, and found that superoxide dismutase activity increased by 221.13%, and polyphenol oxidase activity increased by 486.04% as compared with the origil strain when the implantation time was 300 s. So as to determine the conditions for subsequent mutagenesis. Results and Discussion:For the mutant M 2103, the reaction temperature for xylase production remained stable in the range of 70 degrees C-85 degrees C. Its optimum temperature was 75 degrees C, which was 15 degrees C higher than that of the origil strain. And its xylase activity increased by 21.71% as compared with the origil strain. M 2103 displayed a significantly higher relative xylase activity than the origil strain in the acidic (pH 4.0-7.0) range, and the xylase activity was relatively stable in the pH range of 6.0-8.5. These results provide an altertive biocatalyst for the production of xylooligosaccharide, and a potential USAge of ARTP in the mutagenesis of thermostable mutant.

36478865	PFK2/FBPase-2 is a potential target for metabolic engineering in the filamentous fungus Myceliophthora thermophila	The key enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kise (PFK2)/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase-2) is responsible for regulating the rates of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in eukaryotes. However, its functions and mechanisms in filamentous fungi remain largely enigmatic. In this study, we systematically investigated the function of this enzyme in Myceliophthora thermophila, a thermophilic filamentous fungus with great capacity to produce industrial enzymes and organic acids. Our results showed that the M. thermophila genome encodes three isomers, all with the PFK2/FBPase-2 structure: pfk2-a, pfk2-b, and pfk2-c. Overexpression of each gene revealed that endogenous expression of pfk2-c (PFK2 activity) promoted glucose metabolism, while overexpression of pfk2-a (FBPase-2 activity) inhibited strain growth. Using knockouts, we found that each gene was individually non-essential, but the triple knockout led to significantly slower growth compared with the wild-type strain. Only the pfk2-a single knockout exhibited 22.15% faster sugar metabolism, exerted through activation of 6-phosphofructo-1-kise (PFK1), thereby significantly promoting glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The FBPase-2 deletion mutant strain also exhibited overflow metabolism, and knocking out pfk2-a was proved to be able to improve the production and synthesis rate of various metabolites, such as glycerol and malate. This is the first study to systematically investigate the function of PFK2/FBPase-2 in a thermophilic fungus, providing an effective target for metabolic engineering in filamentous fungi.	6-phosphofructo-2-kise/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase, Myceliophthora thermophila, filamentous fungi, glycolysis, metabolic engineering, metabolic regulation	Frontiers in microbiology	College of Biotechnology, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin, China.

35847290	Role of Surface Enhancement in the Enzymatic Cross-Linking of Lignosulfote Using Altertive Downstream Techniques	Lignosulfote (LS), one of the byproducts of the paper and pulp industry, was mainly used as an energy source in the last decade until the valorization of lignin through different functiolization methods grew in importance. Polymerization using multicopper oxidase laccase (from the Myceliophthora thermophila fungus) is one of such methods, which not only enhances properties such as hydrophobicity, flame retardancy, and bonding properties but can also be used for food and possesses pharmaceutical-like antimicrobial properties and aesthetic features of materials. Appropriate downstream processing methods are needed to produce solids that allow the preservation of particle morphology, a vital factor for the valorization process. In this work, an optimization of the enzymatic polymerization via spray-drying of LS was investigated. The response surface methodology was used to optimize the drying process, reduce the polymerization time, and maximize the dried mass yield. Particles formed showed a concave morphology and enhanced solubility while the temperature sensitivity of spray-drying protected the phenol functiolities beneficial for polymerization. Using the optimized parameters, a yield of 65% in a polymerization time of only 13 min was obtained. The experimental values were found to be in agreement with the predicted values of the factors (R (2): 95.2% and p-value: 0.0001), indicating the suitability of the model in predicting polymerization time and yield of the spray-drying process.

33461124	Fed-batch production of Thermothelomyces thermophilus lignin peroxidase using a recombint Aspergillus nidulans strain in stirred-tank bioreactor	Enzymatic lignin depolymerization is considered a favorable approach to utilize lignin due to the higher selectivity and less energy requirement when compared to thermochemical lignin valorization. Lignin peroxidase (LiP) is one of the key enzymes involved in lignin degradation and possesses high redox potential to oxidize non-phenolic structures and phenolic compounds in lignin. However, the production of LiP is mainly from white-rot fungi at small scales. It is critical to discover new LiP from other microorganisms and produce LiP at large scales. This study aims to produce a novel LiP origilly from Thermothelomyces thermophiles using a recombint Aspergillus nidulans strain. The LiP production medium was optimized, and different fed-batch strategies for LiP production were investigated to improve LiP activity, yield, and productivity. Results demonstrated that LiP production was enhanced by using multi-pulse fed-batch fermentation. A maximum LiP activity of 1,645 mU/L with a protein concentration of 0.26 g/L was achieved.

34489043	Structural studies of Myceliophthora Thermophila Laccase in the presence of deep eutectic solvents	In this work, we elucidated the interactions between Myceliophthora thermophila laccase and deep eutectic solvent (DES) by crystallographic and kinetics alyses. Four types of DESs with different hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) and hydrogen bond donor (HBD), including lactic acid: betaine, glycerol: choline chloride, lactic acid: choline chloride and glycerol: betaine was used. The results revealed that different DES have different effects on laccase activity. Lactic acid-betaine (2:1) DES has shown to enhance laccase activity up to 300 % at a concentration ranged from 2% to 8% v/v, while glycerol: choline chloride and lactic acid: choline chloride DES choline chloride-based DES have found to possess inhibitory effects on laccase under the same concentration range. Detailed kinetic study showed that glycerol: choline chloride DES is a S-parabolic-I-parabolic mixed non-competitive inhibitor, where conformatiol changes can occur. The crystal structures of laccase with lactic acid: choline chloride DES (LCDES) were obtained at 1.6 A. Crystallographic alysis suggested that the addition of LCDES causes changes in the laccase active site, but the increase in water molecules observed in the resulting crystal prevented laccase from experiencing drastic structural change. Fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopies were also applied to determine the effects of DES on the structural conformation of laccase. The results have confirmed that the presence of DES can trigger changes in the local environments of the amino acids in the active site of laccase which contributes to the changes in its activity and stability.

34153346	Survival of thermophilic fungi in various preservation methods: A comparative study	"Thermophilic fungi have several biotechnological and industrial applications such as thermostable enzyme production, biodegradation, and tobacco processing, etc. Thermophilic fungi cannot survive at temperatures below 20  degrees C. Owing to their ibility to grow at low temperatures, they are not stable, so stocking is very difficult. Although a large number of different storage methods are available and described, no method can be universally applied to all fungi. Thermophilic fungi present ""heat-loving"" characteristics, and therefore a new challenge for its preservation and there is no universal protocol for the preservation of thermophilic fungi. The aim of this study was to evaluate the viability, contamition and stability of thermophilic fungi stored under different preservation methods. In this work, 25 thermophilic fungal isolates of species Thermomyces thermophilus, Rhizomucor pusillus, Trichocladium griseum, Melanocarpus albomyces, Malbranchea cinmomea, Thermothelomyces thermophilus, Thermothelomyces hinnuleus,Thermothielavioidesterrestris, Mycothermus thermophilus, Humicola insolens maintained constant sub-culturing at room temperature, +4  degrees C and +20  degrees C, lyophilization at +4  degrees C, freezing at -20  degrees C, freezing block at -20  degrees C and a new technique liquid preservation at room temperature for the periods ranging 5 years. We evaluated the effect of preservation methods by sub-culturing onto either sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) or yeast extract soluble starch agar (YpSs) on growth, production and viability of spores and macro- and micromorphology. In this study, preservation methods for thermophilic fungi were investigated extensively for the first time and it is clearly shown that freezing block at -20  degrees C method and lyophilization were better methods for long-term preservation up to 5 years."

34722005	Oxidized Product Profiles of AA9 Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygeses Depend on the Type of Cellulose	Lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses (LPMOs) are essential for enzymatic conversion of lignocellulose-rich biomass in the context of biofuels and platform chemicals production. Considerable insight into the mode of action of LPMOs has been obtained, but research on the cellulose specificity of these enzymes is still limited. Hence, we studied the product profiles of four fungal Auxiliary Activity family 9 (AA9) LPMOs during their oxidative cleavage of three types of cellulose: bacterial cellulose (BC), Avicel PH-101 (AVI), and regenerated amorphous cellulose (RAC). We observed that attachment of a carbohydrate-binding module 1 (CBM1) did not change the substrate specificity of LPMO9B from Myceliophthora thermophila C1 (MtLPMO9B) but stimulated the degradation of all three types of cellulose. A detailed quantification of oxidized ends in both soluble and insoluble fractions, as well as characterization of oxidized cello-oligosaccharide patterns, suggested that MtLPMO9B generates mainly oxidized cellobiose from BC, while producing oxidized cello-oligosaccharides from AVI and RAC ranged more randomly from DP2-8. Comparable product profiles, resulting from BC, AVI, and RAC oxidation, were found for three other AA9 LPMOs. These distinct cleavage profiles highlight cellulose specificity rather than an LPMO-dependent mechanism and may further reflect that the product profiles of AA9 LPMOs are modulated by different cellulose types.

34771228	Laccase-Mediator System Using a tural Mediator as a Whitening Agent for the Decolorization of Melanin	In this study, a laccase-mediator system (LMS) using a tural mediator was developed as a whitening agent for melanin decolorization. Seven tural mediators were used to replace synthetic mediators and successfully overcome the low redox potential of laccase and limited access of melanin to the active site of laccase. The melanin decolorization activity of laccases from Trametes versicolor (lacT) and Myceliophthora thermophila (lacM) was significantly enhanced using tural mediators including acetosyringone, syringaldehyde, and acetovanillone, which showed low cytotoxicity. The methoxy and ketone groups of tural mediators play an important role in melanin decolorization. The specificity constants of lacT and lacM for melanin decolorization were enhanced by 247 and 334, respectively, when acetosyringone was used as a mediator. LMS using lacM and acetosyringone could also decolorize the melanin present in the cellulose hydrogel film, which mimics the skin condition. Furthermore, LMS could decolorize not only synthetic eumelanin alogs prepared by the oxidation of tyrosine but also tural melanin produced by melanoma cells.	decolorization, laccase, melanin, tural mediators	Polymers	Department of Biological Engineering, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Korea.

33765291	Biochemical characterization and enhanced production of endoxylase from thermophilic mould Myceliophthora thermophila	Endoxylase production from M. thermophila BJTLRMDU3 using rice straw was enhanced to 2.53-fold after optimization in solid state fermentation (SSF). Endoxylase was purified to homogeneity employing ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by gel filtration chromatography and had a molecular mass of ~ 25 kDa estimated by SDS-PAGE. Optimal endoxylase activity was recorded at pH 5.0 and 60  degrees C. Purified enzyme showed complete tolerance to n-hexane, but activity was slightly inhibited by other organic solvents. Among surfactants, Tweens (20, 60, and 80) and Triton X 100 slightly enhanced the enzyme activity. The V(max) and K(m) values for purified endoxylase were 6.29 micromol/min/mg protein and 5.4 mg/ml, respectively. Endoxylase released 79.08 and 42.95% higher reducing sugars and soluble proteins, respectively, which control after 48 h at 60  degrees C from poultry feed. Synergistic effect of endoxylase (100 U/g) and phytase (15 U/g) on poultry feed released higher amount of reducing sugars (58.58 mg/feed), soluble proteins (42.48 mg/g feed), and inorganic phosphate (28.34 mg/feed) in contrast to control having 23.55, 16.98, and 10.46 mg/feed of reducing sugars, soluble proteins, and inorganic phosphate, respectively, at 60  degrees C supplemented with endoxylase only.

34735642	Recombint cellobiohydrolase of Myceliophthora thermophila: characterization and applicability in cellulose saccharification	A codon optimized cellobiohydrolase (CBH) encoding synthetic gene of 1188 bp from a thermophilic mold Myceliophthora thermophila (MtCel6A) was cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli for the first time. In silico alysis suggested that MtCel6A is a GH6 CBH and belongs to CBHII family, which is structurally similar to Cel6A of Humicola insolens. The recombint MtCel6A is expressed as active inclusion bodies, and the molecular mass of the purified enzyme is ~ 45 kDa. The rMtCel6A is active in a wide range of pH (4-12) and temperatures (40-100  degrees C) with optima at pH 10.0 and 60  degrees C. It exhibits T(1/2) of 6.0 and 1.0 h at 60 and 90  degrees C, respectively. The rMtCel6A is an extremozyme with organic solvent, salt and alkali tolerance. The K(m), V(max), k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m) values of the enzyme are 3.2 mg mL(-1), 222.2 mumol mg(-1) min(-1), 2492 s(-1) and 778.7 s(-1) mg(-1) mL(-1), respectively. The product alysis of rMtCel6A confirmed that it is an exoenzyme that acts from the non-reducing end of cellulose. The addition of rMtCel6A to the commercial cellulase mix (Cellic CTec2) led to 1.9-fold increase in saccharification of the pre-treated sugarcane bagasse. The rMtCel6A is a potential CBH that finds utility in industrial processes such as in bioethanol, paper pulp and textile industries.

35155404	Enzymatic Oxidation of Ca-Lignosulfote and Kraft Lignin in Different Lignin-Laccase-Mediator-Systems and MDF Production	Laccase-mediator-oxidized lignin offers replacement for conventiol chemical binders to produce fiberboards. Compared to the previously reported laccase-mediator system (LMS), a lignin-laccase-mediator-system (LLMS) has an advantage in that it requires much shorter fiber-enzyme incubation time due to significantly increased redox reactions. However, the cost of regularly applying laccase on an industrial scale is currently too high. We have employed CcLcc5 from cultures of the basidiomycete Coprinopsis cinerea as a novel basi-laccase (a CAZy subfamily AA1_1 laccase) in medium-density fiberboard (MDF) production, in comparison to the commercial formulation Novozym 51003 with recombintly produced asco-laccase MtL (a CAZy subfamily AA1_3 laccase-like multicopper oxidase from the ascomycete Myceliophthora thermophila). With the best-performing tural mediator 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP), unpurified CcLcc5 was almost as good as formulated Novozym 51003 in increasing the molecular weight (MW) of the technical lignins tested, the hydrophilic high-MW Ca-lignosulfote and the hydrophobic low-MW kraft lignin (Indulin AT). Oxygen consumption rates of the two distantly related, poorly conserved enzymes (31% sequence identity) with different mediators and lignosulfote were also comparable, but Indulin AT significantly reduced the oxidative activity of Novozym 51003 unlike CcLcc5, regardless of the mediator used, either DMP or guaiacol. Oxygen uptake by both laccases was much faster with both technical lignins with DMP than with guaiacol. In case of lignosulfote and DMP, 20-30 min of incubation was sufficient for full oxygen consumption, which fits in well in time with the usual binder application steps in industrial MDF production processes. LLMS-bonded MDF was thus produced on a pilot-plant scale with either crude CcLcc5 or Novozym 51003 at reduced enzyme levels of 5 kU/kg absolutely dry wood fiber with lignosulfote and mediator DMP. Boards produced with CcLcc5 were comparably good as those made with Novozym 51003. Boards reached nearly standard specifications in interl bond strength (IB) and modulus of rupture (MOR), while thickness swelling (TS) was less good based on the hydrophilic character of lignosulfote. LLMS-bonded MDF with Indulin AT and DMP performed better in TS but showed reduced IB and MOR values.	2,6-dimethoxyphenol, Ca-lignosulfote, MDF, asco-laccase MtL, basi-laccase CcLcc5, guaiacol, kraft lignin, mediator	Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology	Department of Molecular Wood Biotechnology and Technical Mycology, Busgen-Institute, Georg-August-University of Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.

34631225	Accessing Chemo- and Regioselective Benzylic and Aromatic Oxidations by Protein Engineering of an Unspecific Peroxygese	Unspecific peroxygeses (UPOs) eble oxyfunctiolizations of a broad substrate range with unparalleled activities. Tailoring these enzymes for chemo- and regioselective transformations represents a grand challenge due to the difficulties in their heterologous productions. Herein, we performed protein engineering in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the MthUPO from Myceliophthora thermophila. More than 5300 transformants were screened. This protein engineering led to a significant reshaping of the active site as elucidated by computatiol modelling. The reshaping was responsible for the increased oxyfunctiolization activity, with improved k (cat)/K (m) values of up to 16.5-fold for the model substrate 5-nitro-1,3-benzodioxole. Moreover, variants were identified with high chemo- and regioselectivities in the oxyfunctiolization of aromatic and benzylic carbons, respectively. The benzylic hydroxylation was demonstrated to perform with entioselectivities of up to 95% ee. The proposed evolutiory protocol and ratiolization of the enhanced activities and selectivities acquired by MthUPO variants represent a step forward toward the use and implementation of UPOs in biocatalytic synthetic pathways of industrial interest.

33352160	Polymer functiolization through an enzymatic process: Intermediate products characterization and their grafting onto gum Arabic	The modification of gum Arabic with ferulic acid oxidation products was performed in aqueous medium, at 30  degrees C and pH 7.5, in the presence of Myceliophthora thermophila laccase as biocatalyst. First, this study aimed to investigate the structures of the oxidation products of ferulic acid that could possibly be covalently grafted onto gum Arabic. HPLC alyses revealed that this reaction produced several oxidation products, whose structures were investigated using LC-MS/MS alyses (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with mass fragmentation alyses) and NMR experiments. The chemical structure of one intermediate reaction product was fully elucidated as the 2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-4-[(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) methylidene] cyclobutane-1, 3-dione, called by the authors cyclobutadiferulone. Secondly, this study aimed to locate the grafting of the oxidation products onto gum Arabic by performing several NMR experiments. This study did not determine how much and specifically which oxidation products were grafted but some of them were undeniably present onto modified gum Arabic, close to the glucuronic acid C5 carbon or close to the galactose C6 carbon.

The optimum temperature and pH values for the oxidation of ABTS by laccase were determined to be 70  degrees C and pH 3.0. After 6 h at 50  degrees C, laccase activity was diminished by about 13 % in the free form and 28 %, in the immobilized form. K(m) values for both free and cross-linked laccase were 0.051 and 0.567 mM, whereas V(max) values were 2.027 and 0.854 mumol. min(-1), respectively. The immobilized laccase was able to preserve its full activity for 6 weeks, retaining approximately 95 % and 78 % of its initial activity after 8 and 20 weeks, respectively. The contact angles were two-fold higher when the laccase enzyme was occupied in the biografting reaction, revealing that the hydrophobic compound bonded stably onto beechwood samples.

34771293	Screening of Lignocellulolytic Enzyme Activities in Fungal Species and Sequential Solid-State and Submerged Cultivation for the Production of Enzyme Cocktails	Various fungal species can degrade lignocellulolytic materials with their enzyme cocktails composed of cellulolytic and lignolytic enzymes. In this work, seven fungal species (Mucor indicus DSM 2185, Paecilomyces variotii CBS 372.70, Myceliophthora thermophila CBS 663.74, Thielavia terrestris CBS 456.75, Botryosphaeria dothidea JCM 2738, FUSArium oxysporum f.sp. langeriae JCM 9293, and FUSArium verticillioides JCM 23107) and four nutrient media were used in the screening for effective lignocellulose degrading enzymes. From the seven tested fungi, F. oxysporum and F. verticilliodes, along with nutrient medium 4, were selected as the best medium and producers of lignocellulolytic enzymes based on the determined xylase (>4 U mg(-1)) and glucase activity ( approximately 2 U mg(-1)). Nutrient medium 4 supplemented with pretreated corn cobs was used in the production of lignocellulolytic enzymes by sequential solid-state and submerged cultivation of F. oxysporum, F. verticilliodes, and a mixed culture of both strains. F. oxysporum showed 6 times higher exoglucase activity (3.33 U mg(-1)) after 5 days of cultivation in comparison with F. verticillioides (0.55 U mg(-1)). F. oxysporum also showed 2 times more endoglucase activity (0.33 U mg(-1)). The mixed culture cultivation showed similar endo- and exoglucase activities compared to F. oxysporum (0.35 U mg(-1); 7.84 U mg(-1)). Maximum xylase activity was achieved after 7 days of cultivation of F. verticilliodes ( approximately 16 U mg(-1)), while F. oxysporum showed maximum activity after 9 days that was around 2 times lower compared to that of F. verticilliodes. The mixed culture achieved maximum xylase activity after only 4 days, but the specific activity was similar to activities observed for F. oxysporum. It can be concluded that both fungal strains can be used as producers of enzyme cocktails for the degradation of lignocellulose containing raw materials, and that corn cobs can be used as an inducer for enzyme production.

31309856	Isolation and characterization of a new cytotoxic polyketide-amino acid hybrid from Thermothelomyces thermophilus ATCC 42464	Fungi are a rich source of novel anticancer compounds. Bioassay-guided isolation has led to the isolation of four polyketide-amino acid hybrid compounds with trans-fused decalin system from the fungus Thermothelomyces thermophilus ATCC 42464 (=Myceliophthora thermophila ATCC 42464): myceliothermophins A, B, E and F (1-4). The structure of the new compound (myceliothermophin F, compound 4) was clearly determined by a combition of nuclear magnetic resonce (NMR) alysis and high-resolution electrospray ionisation mass spectroscopy (HRESIMS). The new compound exhibited promising cytotoxicity against some cell lines derived from colorectal carcinoma, hepatic carcinoma and gastric carcinoma, indicating that compounds with trans-fused decalin system would be promising in the course of developing novel anticancer drugs.

33995328	Transcriptiol Profiling of Myceliophthora thermophila on Galactose and Metabolic Engineering for Improved Galactose Utilization	Efficient biological conversion of all sugars from lignocellulosic biomass is necessary for the cost-effective production of biofuels and commodity chemicals. Galactose is one of the most abundant sugar in many hemicelluloses, and it will be important to capture this carbon for an efficient bioconversion process of plant biomass. Thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila has been used as a cell factory to produce biochemicals directly from renewable polysaccharides. In this study, we draw out the two tive galactose utilization pathways, including the Leloir pathway and oxido-reductive pathway, and identify the significance and contribution of them, through transcriptiol profiling alysis of M. thermophila and its mutants on galactose. We find that galactokise was necessary for galactose transporter expression, and disruption of galK resulted in decreased galactose utilization. Through metabolic engineering, both galactokise deletion and galactose transporter overexpression can activate interl the oxido-reductive pathway and improve the consumption rate of galactose. Filly, the heterologous galactose-degradation pathway, De Ley-Doudoroff (DLD) pathway, was successfully integrated into M. thermophila, and the consumption rate of galactose in the engineered strain was increased by 57%. Our study focuses on metabolic engineering for accelerating galactose utilization in a thermophilic fungus that will be beneficial for the ratiol design of fungal strains to produce biofuels and biochemicals from a variety of feedstocks with abundant galactose.

34513809	Improved Production of Xylase in Pichia pastoris and Its Application in Xylose Production From Xylan	Xylases with high specific activity has been focused with great interest as a useful enzyme in biomass utilization. The production of recombint GH11 xylase (MYCTH_56237) from Myceliophthora thermophila has been improved through N-termil sigl peptide engineering in P. pastoris. The production of newly recombint xylase (termed Mtxyn11C) was improved from 442.53 to 490.7 U/mL, through a replacement of alpha-factor sigl peptide with the tive xylase sigl peptide segment (MVSVKAVLLLGAAGTTLA) in P. pastoris. Scaling up of Mtxyn11C production in a 7.5 L fermentor was improved to the maximal production rate of 2503 U/mL. In this study, the degradation efficiency of Mtxyn11C was further examined. Alysis of the hydrolytic mode of action towards the birchwood xylan (BWX) revealed that Mtxyn11C was clearly more effective than commercial xylase and degrades xylan into xylooligosaccharides (xylobiose, xylotriose, xylotetraose). More importantly, Mtxyn11C in combition with a single multifunctiol xylanolytic enzyme, improved the hydrolysis of BWX into single xylose by 40%. Altogether, this study provided strategies for improved production of xylase together with rapid conversion of xylose from BWX, which provides sustaible, cost-effective and environmental friendly approaches to produce xylose/XOSs for biomass energy or biofuels production.

35127677	Designing and Constructing a Novel Artificial Pathway for Malonic Acid Production Biologically	Malonic acid is used as a common component of many products and processes in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Here, we designed a novel artificial synthetic pathway of malonic acid, in which oxaloacetate, an intermediate of cytoplasmic reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) pathway, is converted to malonic semialdehyde and then to malonic acid, sequentially catalyzed by a-keto decarboxylase and malonic semialdehyde dehydrogese. After the systematic screening, we discovered the enzyme oxaloacetate decarboxylase Mdc, catalyzing the first step of the artificially designed pathway in vitro. Then, this synthetic pathway was functiolly constructed in cellulolytic thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila. After enhancement of glucose uptake, the titer of malonic acid achieved 42.5 mg/L. This study presents a novel biological pathway for producing malonic acid from renewable resources in the future.

34556173	Coordition of consolidated bioprocessing technology and carbon dioxide fixation to produce malic acid directly from plant biomass in Myceliophthora thermophila	BACKGROUND: Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) technique is a promising strategy for biorefinery construction, producing bulk chemicals directly from plant biomass without extra hydrolysis steps. Fixing and channeling CO(2) into carbon metabolism for increased carbon efficiency in producing value-added compounds is another strategy for cost-effective bio-manufacturing. It has not been reported whether these two strategies can be combined in one microbial platform. RESULTS: In this study, using the cellulolytic thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila, we designed and constructed a novel biorefinery system DMCC (Direct microbial conversion of biomass with CO(2) fixation) through incorporating two CO(2) fixation modules, PYC module and Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) pathway. Harboring the both modules, the average rate of fixing and channeling (13)CO(2) into malic acid in strain CP51 achieved 44.4, 90.7, and 80.7 mg/L/h, on xylose, glucose, and cellulose, respectively. The corresponding titers of malic acid were up to 42.1, 70.4, and 70.1 g/L, respectively, representing the increases of 40%, 10%, and 7%, respectively, compared to the parental strain possessing only PYC module. The DMCC system was further improved by enhancing the pentose uptake ability. Using raw plant biomass as the feedstock, yield of malic acid produced by the DMCC system was up to 0.53 g/g, with (13)C content of 0.44 mol/mol malic acid, suggesting DMCC system can produce 1 t of malic acid from 1.89 t of biomass and fix 0.14 t CO(2) accordingly. CONCLUSIONS: This study designed and constructed a novel biorefinery system med DMCC, which can convert raw plant biomass and CO(2) into organic acid efficiently, presenting a promising strategy for cost-effective production of value-added compounds in biorefinery. The DMCC system is one of great options for realization of carbon neutral economy.

32640074	Growth kinetics of Myceliophthora thermophila M.7.7 in solid-state cultivation	AIMS: This work aimed to estimate the growth of Myceliophthora thermophila M.7.7 in solid-state cultivation (SSC) through quantification of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (G) and enzyme activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: The fungus was cultivated in sugarcane bagasse and wheat bran. A consistent statistical alysis was done to assess the reliability of experimental data. Logistic model equation was fitted to experimental data and growth parameters were estimated. The results showed strong influence of the sample size on G and a minimum recommended sample size was identified. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to identify the strategy of substrate colonization. Wheat bran was attacked firstly, while sugarcane bagasse was consumed after wheat bran depletion. The biomass growth was poorly estimated by secretion kinetics of alpha-amylase, endoglucase, protease and xylase, but enzyme kinetics were important for understanding substrate colonization. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the G concentration was strongly affected by the sample size and sampling procedure. The strategy of fungal colonization on the substrates was well characterized through SEM alysis. The colonization strategy has direct influence on the kinetic parameters of the logistic model. Myceliophthora thermophila has a well-defined dymic of enzyme secretion to degrade the substrate, although the kinetics of enzyme secretion has shown not adequate to characterize the kinetics of fungal growth. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The paper provides reliable growth kinetic parameters in the SSC of the cellulase producer fungus M. thermophila M.7.7, as well as a robust alysis on three indirect methods (G, enzymes and SEM) for estimation of fungal development.

33807631	Prospection of Fungal Lignocellulolytic Enzymes Produced from Jatoba (Hymeea courbaril) and Tamarind (Tamarindus indica) Seeds: Scaling for Bioreactor and Saccharification Profile of Sugarcane Bagasse	The lignocellulosic biomass comprises three main components: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Degradation and conversion of these three components are attractive to biotechnology. This study aimed to prospect fungal lignocellulolytic enzymes with potential industrial applications, produced through a temporal alysis using Hymeea courbaril and Tamarindus indica seeds as carbon sources. alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase, acetyl xylan esterase, endo-1,5-alpha-L-arabise, beta-D-galactosidase, beta-D-glucosidase, beta-glucase, beta-D-xylosidase, cellobiohydrolase, endoglucase, lichese, manse, polygalacturose, endo-1,4-beta-xylase, and xyloglucase activities were determined. The enzymes were produced for eight filamentous fungi: Aspergillus fumigatus, Trametes hirsuta, Lasiodiplodia sp., two strains of Trichoderma longibrachiatum, Neocosmospora perseae, FUSArium sp. and Thermothelomyces thermophilus. The best producers concerning enzymatic activity were T. thermophilus and T. longibrachiatum. The optimal conditions for enzyme production were the media supplemented with tamarind seeds, under agitation, for 72 h. This alysis was essential to demonstrate that cultivation conditions, static and under agitation, exert strong influences on the production of several enzymes produced by different fungi. The kind of sugarcane, pretreatment used, microorganisms, and carbon sources proved limiting sugar profile factors.

33222033	Improving enzyme production by solid-state cultivation in packed-bed bioreactors by changing bed porosity and airflow distribution	Enzymes production by solid-state cultivation in packed-bed bioreactor needs to be improved by mathematical modeling and also by experimentation. In this work, a mixture of sugarcane bagasse and wheat bran was used for the growth of the fungus Myceliophthora thermophila I-1D3b, able to secrete endoglucase and xylase, enzymes of interest in the second-generation ethanol production. Bench and pilot-scale bioreactors were used for the experiments, while critical parameters as bed porosity and airflow distribution were evaluated. Results showed enzymes with higher activities for the most porous medium, even though the less substrate amount to be cultivated. For the pilot-scale bioreactor, only the most porous medium was evaluated using different airflow distribution techniques. Using an inner tube for air supply resulted in more homogeneous enzyme production, with higher activities. The results here presented will be helpful for the scale-up of this class of bioreactor into industrial apparatuses.

33712158	Light-stimulated T. thermophilus two-domain LPMO9H: Low-resolution SAXS model and synergy with cellulases	Lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses (LPMOs), monocopper enzymes that oxidatively cleave recalcitrant polysaccharides, have important biotechnological applications. Thermothelomyces thermophilus is a rich source of biomass-active enzymes, including many members from auxiliary activities family 9 LPMOs. Here, we report biochemical and structural characterization of recombint TtLPMO9H which oxidizes cellulose at the C1 and C4 positions and shows enhanced activity in light-driven catalysis assays. TtLPMO9H also shows activity against xyloglucan. The addition of TtLPMO9H to endoglucases from four different glucoside hydrolase families (GH5, GH12, GH45 and GH7) revealed that the product formation was remarkably increased when TtLPMO9H was combined with GH7 endoglucase. Filly, we determind the first low resolution small-angle X-ray scattering model of the two-domain TtLPMO9H in solution that shows relative positions of its two functiol domains and a conformation of the linker peptide, which can be relevant for the catalytic oxidation of cellulose and xyloglucan.

34336809	Enzyme Catalyzed Copolymerization of Lignosulfotes for Hydrophobic Coatings	Enzymatic polymerization of lignin can generate a variety of value-added products concomitantly replacing fossil-based resources. In line with this approach, a laccase from the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila (MtL) was used to couple a hydrophobicity enhancing fluorophenol (FP) molecule, mely 4-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]phenol (4,4-F3MPP), as a model substrate onto lignosulfote (LS). During the coupling reaction changes in fluorescence, phenol content, viscosity and molecular weight (size exclusion chromatography; SEC) were monitored. The effects of enzymatic coupling of FP onto LS on hydrophobicity were investigated by the means of water contact angle (WCA) measurement and determition of swelling capacity. Full polymerization of LS resulting in the production of water-insoluble polymers was achieved at a pH of 7 and 33 degrees C. Incorporation of 2% (w/v) of FP led to an increase in WCA by 59.2% while the swelling capacity showed a decrease by 216.8%. Further, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) alysis indicated successful covalent coupling of the FP molecule onto LS by an emerging peak at 1,320 cm(-1) in the FTIR spectrum and the evidence of Fluor in the XPS spectrum. This study shows the ability of laccase to mediate the tailoring of LS properties to produce functiol polymers.	coating, coupling, fluorophenol, hydrophobicity, laccase, lignosulfote, modification	Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology	Institute of Environmental Biotechnology, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Tulln, Austria.

33521846	Strategic aromatic residues in the catalytic cleft of the xyloglucase MtXgh74 modifying thermostability, mode of enzyme action, and viscosity reduction ability	"The thermostable endo-processive xyloglucase MtXgh74 from Myceliophthora thermophila was used to study the influence of aromatic amino acids in the catalytic cleft on the mode of action and the ability of enzyme to reduce xyloglucan viscosity. The enzyme derivative Mut I with mutations W64A/W67A in the ""negative"" subsites of the catalytic cleft resulted in a 5.5-fold increase of the K(m) value. Mut I produced oligosaccharides of various lengths in addition to xyloglucan building blocks. The W320A/W321A substitutions in the ""positive"" subsites of the mutated enzyme Mut II catalytic cleft increased the K(m) value 54-fold and resulted in an endo-dissociative mode of action. The ability of Mut II to reduce the viscosity of xyloglucan at 50  degrees C was much better than that of other MtXgh74 variants. Besides, Mut II efficiently reduced viscosity of a tural substrate, the pulp of xyloglucan-containing tamarind seed flour. The K(m), V(max), and k(cat) values and viscosity reduction ability of the enzyme derivative Mut III (W320A/W321A/G446Y) returned to levels close to that of MtXgh74. The pattern of xyloglucan hydrolysis by Mut III was typical for endo-processive xyloglucases. The thermostability of Mut I and Mut II at 60  degrees C decreased significantly compared to the wild type, whereas the thermostability of Mut III at 60  degrees C restored almost to the MtXgh74-wt value. All mutants lost the ability to cleave the backbone of xyloglucan building blocks which was a characteristic of MtXgh74. Instead they acquired a low branch removing activity. Molecular dymics simulations revealed the role of mutated amino acids in the complex action mechanism of GH74 enzymes. KEY POINTS: * Endo-processive mode of action of the xyloglucase MtXgh74 was altered by ratiol design. * The endo-dissociative mutant Mut II (W320A/W321A) efficiently reduced XyG viscosity. * The substitutions W320A/W321A/G446Y in Mut III recovered the endo-processive mode. * Mut II can be used to reduce the viscosity of biomass slurries containing tamarind seed flour."

34168079	The F-box protein gene exo-1 is a target for reverse engineering enzyme hypersecretion in filamentous fungi	Carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) are vital for the lignocellulose-based biorefinery. The development of hypersecreting fungal protein production hosts is therefore a major aim for both academia and industry. However, despite advances in our understanding of their regulation, the number of promising candidate genes for targeted strain engineering remains limited. Here, we resequenced the genome of the classical hypersecreting Neurospora crassa mutant exo-1 and identified the caUSAtive point of mutation to reside in the F-box protein-encoding gene, NCU09899. The corresponding deletion strain displayed amylase and invertase activities exceeding those of the carbon catabolite derepressed strain Deltacre-1, while glucose repression was still mostly functiol in Deltaexo-1 Surprisingly, R sequencing revealed that while plant cell wall degradation genes are broadly misexpressed in Deltaexo-1, only a small fraction of CAZyme genes and sugar transporters are up-regulated, indicating that EXO-1 affects specific regulatory factors. Aiming to elucidate the underlying mechanism of enzyme hypersecretion, we found the high secretion of amylases and invertase in Deltaexo-1 to be completely dependent on the transcriptiol regulator COL-26. Furthermore, misregulation of COL-26, CRE-1, and cellular carbon and nitrogen metabolism was confirmed by proteomics. Filly, we successfully transferred the hypersecretion trait of the exo-1 disruption by reverse engineering into the industrially deployed fungus Myceliophthora thermophila using CRISPR-Cas9. Our identification of an important F-box protein demonstrates the strength of classical mutants combined with next-generation sequencing to uncover unticipated candidates for engineering. These data contribute to a more complete understanding of CAZyme regulation and will facilitate targeted engineering of hypersecretion in further organisms of interest.

32620929	Structural insight into mitochondrial beta-barrel outer membrane protein biogenesis	In mitochondria, beta-barrel outer membrane proteins mediate protein import, metabolite transport, lipid transport, and biogenesis. The Sorting and Assembly Machinery (SAM) complex consists of three proteins that assemble as a 1:1:1 complex to fold beta-barrel proteins and insert them into the mitochondrial outer membrane. We report cryoEM structures of the SAM complex from Myceliophthora thermophila, which show that Sam50 forms a 16-stranded transmembrane beta-barrel with a single polypeptide-transport-associated (POTRA) domain extending into the intermembrane space. Sam35 and Sam37 are located on the cytosolic side of the outer membrane, with Sam35 capping Sam50, and Sam37 interacting extensively with Sam35. Sam35 and Sam37 each adopt a GST-like fold, with no functiol, structural, or sequence similarity to their bacterial counterparts. Structural alysis shows how the Sam50 beta-barrel opens a lateral gate to accommodate its substrates.

33301505	Safety evaluation of a beta-manse enzyme preparation produced with Thermothelomyces thermophilus expressing a protein-engineered beta-manse gene	Manse 19287 enzyme is an engineered beta-manse that can be added to diets for animals raised for human consumption to hydrolyze beta-manns. Established toxicological alyses were conducted with the enzyme preparation to ensure the safety of this product for the intended use. The manse 19287 preparation was produced with Thermothelomyces thermophilus strain DSM 33149. In vitro toxicity studies presented here used dosages of the manse 19287 test articles up to 5000 mug/plate. For in vivo toxicity studies in Wistar rats, test articles were administered at 5.1 mg/L for inhalation toxicity and up to 15,000 mg/kg rat feed for oral toxicity, based on the Total Organic Solids (TOS) content in each test article. No treatment related adverse effects were reported in any study. The No Observed Adverse Effect Levels in the high dose group of the subchronic oral toxicity study were calculated as 1117-1298 mg TOS/kg bw/day in rats. Comparing these values to an Estimated Daily Intake for poultry demonstrated safety factors larger than 5000. Our results confirm that T. thermophilus fulfills the recognized safety criteria for the manufacture of food enzyme preparations and represent the first peer-reviewed safety evaluation of an enzyme preparation by T. thermophilus. The results of the toxicity studies presented herein attest to the safety of the manse 19287 enzyme for its intended use.		PloS one	BASF Corporation, San Diego, California, United States of America.

33043425	Effect of Metal Ions on the Activity of Ten D-Dependent Formate Dehydrogeses	D-dependent formate dehydrogese (FDH) enzymes are frequently used in industrial and scientific applications. FDH is a reversible enzyme that reduces the D molecule to DH and produces CO(2) by oxidation of the formate ion, whereas it causes CO(2) reduction in the reverse reaction. Some transition metal elements - Fe(3+), Mo(6+) and W(6 +) - can be found in the FDH structure of aerobic and archaeal microorganisms, and these enzymes require cations and other redox-active cofactors for their FDH activity. While D-dependent FDHs do not necessarily require any metal cations, the presence of various metal cations can still affect FDH activities. To study the effect of 11 different metal ions, D-dependent FDH enzymes from ten different microorganisms were tested: Ancylobacter aquaticus (AaFDH), Candida boidinii (CboFDH), Candida methylica (CmFDH), Ceriporiopsis subvermispora (CsFDH), Chaetomium thermophilum (CtFDH), Moraxella sp. (MsFDH), Myceliophthora thermophila (MtFDH), Paracoccus sp. (PsFDH), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScFDH) and Thiobacillus sp. (TsFDH). It was found that metal ions (mainly Cu(2+) and Zn(2+)) could have quite strong inhibition effects on several enzymes in the forward reaction, whereas several cations (Li(+), Mg(2+), Mn(2+), Fe(3+) and W(6+)) could increase the forward reaction of two FDHs. The highest activity increase (1.97 fold) was caused by Fe(3+) in AaFDH. The effect on the reverse reaction was minimal. The modelled structures of ten FDHs showed that the active site is formed by 15 highly conserved amino acid residues spatially settling around the formate binding site in a conserved way. However, the residue differences at some of the sites close to the substrate do not explain the activity differences. The active site space is very tight, excluding water molecules, as observed in earlier studies. Structural examition indicated that smaller metal ions might be spaced close to the active site to affect the reaction. Metal ion size showed partial correlation to the effect on inhibition or activation. Affinity of the substrate may also affect the sensitivity to the metal's effect. In addition, amino acid differences on the protein surface may also be important for the metal ion effect.

33292403	Characterization of an AA9 LPMO from Thielavia australiensis, TausLPMO9B, under industrially relevant lignocellulose saccharification conditions	BACKGROUND: The discovery of lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses (LPMO) has changed our perspective on enzymatic degradation of plant biomass. Through an oxidative mechanism, these enzymes are able to cleave and depolymerize various polysaccharides, acting not only on crystalline substrates such as chitin and cellulose, but also on other polysaccharides, such as xyloglucan, glucomann and starch. Despite their widespread use, uncertainties related to substrate specificity and stereospecificity, the ture of the co-substrate, in-process stability, and the ture of the optimal reductant challenge their exploitation in biomass processing applications. RESULTS: In this work, we studied the properties of a novel fungal LPMO from the thermophilic fungus Thielavia australiensis, TausLPMO9B. Heterologous expression of TausLPMO9B in Aspergillus niger yielded a glycosylated protein with a methylated N-termil histidine showing LPMO activity. High sequence identity of the AA9 domain to that of MtLPMO9B (MYCTH_80312) from Myceliophthora thermophila (84%) indicated strictly C1-oxidizing activity on cellulose, which was confirmed experimentally by the alysis of products released from cellulose using HPAEC. The enzyme was stable and active at a pH ranging from 4 to 6, thus matching the conditions commonly used in industrial biomass processing, where a low pH (between 4 and 5) is used due to the pH-optima of commercial cellulases and a desire to limit microbial contamition. CONCLUSION: While the oxidative cleavage of phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) by TausLPMO9B was boosted by the addition of H(2)O(2) as a co-substrate, this effect was not observed during the saccharification of acid pretreated corn stover. This illustrates key differences between the lab-scale tests with artificial, lignin-free substrates and industrial settings with lignocellulosic biomass as substrate.

32866595	Molecular dymics simulations of two GH74 endo-processive xyloglucases and the mutated variants to understand better the mechanism of the enzyme action	BACKGROUND: GH74 xyloglucases are composed of two separate domains connected by two unstructured peptides. Previously, a hypothesis was made that the movement of domains may affect the enzyme mechanism of catalysis. METHODS: The molecular dymics (MD) simulations of endo-processive xyloglucases from Paenibacillus odorifer (PoGH74(cat)) and Myceliophthora thermophila (MtXeg74A) were carried out. RESULTS: MD simulations for both enzymes in complex with XXLG and XGXXLG oligosaccharides confirmed the possibility of domain movement. In the case of MtXeg74A, changes in the distances between C(alpha) atoms of aromatic residues involved in xyloglucan binding in -3 and +3 subsites of the active site cleft and those of selected residues on the opposite side of the cleft reached values up to 10-12 A. For PoGH74(cat) the conformatiol changes were less pronounced. In MtXeg74A variants, the deletion of loop 1, which partially closes the entrance to the cleft, and the additiol double mutation of two Trp residues in +3 and +5 subsites caused the enhanced mobility of the XGXXLG and also induced changes in topography of the cleft. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the possibility of existence of GH74 xyloglucases in a more open and more closed enzyme conformation. The enzyme in an open conformation may more easily accommodate the branched polysaccharide, while its transition to the closed conformation, together with loop 1 function, should aid processivity. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Our results provide an insight into a mechanism of action of GH74 xyloglucases and may be useful for discussing the catalytic mechanisms of glycoside hydrolases from other families.

33219291	Quantitative comparison of the biomass-degrading enzyme repertoires of five filamentous fungi	The efficiency of microorganisms to degrade lignified plants is of great importance in the Earth's carbon cycle, but also in industrial biorefinery processes, such as for biofuel production. Here, we present a large-scale proteomics approach to investigate and compare the enzymatic response of five filamentous fungi when grown on five very different substrates: grass (sugarcane bagasse), hardwood (birch), softwood (spruce), cellulose and glucose. The five fungi included the ascomycetes Aspergillus terreus, Trichoderma reesei, Myceliophthora thermophila, Neurospora crassa and the white-rot basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium, all expressing a diverse repertoire of enzymes. In this study, we present comparable quantitative protein abundance values across five species and five diverse substrates. The results allow for direct comparison of fungal adaptation to the different substrates, give indications as to the substrate specificity of individual carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), and reveal proteins of unknown function that are co-expressed with CAZymes. Based on the results, we present a quantitative comparison of 34 lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses (LPMOs), which are crucial enzymes in biomass deconstruction.

Maximum xylase production (20.35 U/g substrate) was achieved by Bacillus substilis subsp. subtilis JJBS250 using 'one variable at a time approach' at pH 7.0, 40  degrees C after 48 h. After statistical optimization by response surface methodology (RSM) there was 4.82-fold improvement in xylase production (98.16 U/g substrate). Further optimization of untreated and sodium carbote pretreated sugarcane bagasse enzymatic hydrolysis was carried out using both bacterial (Bacillus substilis subsp. subtilis JJBS250) and fungal (Myceliophthora thermophila BJTLRMDU3) xylases that showed high amount of reducing sugar liberation from untreated sugarcane bagasse (124.24 mg/g substrate) as compared to pretreated (76.23 mg/g substrate) biomass. Furthermore, biophysical characterization of untreated and sodium carbote pretreated sugarcane bagasse using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), revealed the structural changes in the pretreated biomass.

31602502	Endophytic fungi from the medicil herb Euphorbia geniculata as a potential source for bioactive metabolites	Many researchers proved that plant endophytes mage successful issues to synthesize active chemicals within plant cells. These bioactive compounds might support a range of plant defense mechanism against many pathogenic microorganisms. In this study, a total of 22 isolates representing 21 fungal species belonging to 15 fungal genera in addition to one variety were isolated and identified for the first time from Euphorbia geniculate plants. The genus Aspergillus was the most common fungus isolated from the studied plant. The fungus Isaria feline was recorded in both leaves and stem, while Aspergillus flavus, A. ochraceus, A. terreus var. terreus, Emercilla nidulans var. acristata, Macrophomi phaseoli colonized both stem and root. The isolated fungi showed antagonistic activities against six strains of plant pathogenic fungi viz., Eupenicillium brefeldianum, Penicillium echinulatum, Alterria phragmospora, FUSArium oxysporum, FUSArium verticilloid, and Alterria alterta in dual culture assay. The highest antagonistic activity fungal species (Aspergillus flavus, A. fumigatus, and FUSArium lateritium) and the lowest (Cladosprium herbarum, F. culomrum, and Sporotrichum thermophile) showed twining in their secondary metabolites especially terpens and alkaloids with that of their host E. geniculata. Three concentrations of (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/ml) of these secondary metabolites extracted by ethyl acetate and n-butanol from the above six endophytic fungal species were tested against three pathogenic fungi isolated from infected tomato plant (E. brefeldianum-EBT-1, P. echinulatum-PET-2, and A. phragmospora-APT-3), whereas these pathogens showed promising sensitivity to these fungal secondary metabolites. In conclusion, this is the first report on the isolation of endophytic fungi from E. geniculata and evaluation of their antifungal activity.

31802333	Improving cellulases production by Myceliophthora thermophila through disruption of protease genes	OBJECTIVE: To identify main protease genes for the proteolytic degradation of cellulases in M. thermophila and generate a lower-proteases fungal host that can be used for further metabolic engineering to increase cellulase production and heterologous protein expression. RESULTS: Systematic transcriptomic alysis were conducted on the expression of proteases genes in M. thermophila genome and five highly expressed genes encoding extracellular proteases were selected for mutation alyses. A series of single- and multi-gene mutants of these five selected genes was constructed using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique. Compared with WT, the DeltaMtalp1 and the quintuple mutant showed significantly lower protease activity (decreased 52.7% and 58.4%, respectively) and at least double enhanced cellulase production. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that Mtalp1 is a critical protease gene in cellulase degradation in M. thermophila and disruption of protease genes showed significantly decreased protease activity and obviously enhanced cellulase production in the fermentation broth of DeltaMtalp1 and the quintuple mutant.

32021654	Metabolic engineering of the cellulolytic thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila to produce ethanol from cellobiose	BACKGROUND: Cellulosic biomass is a promising resource for bioethanol production. However, various sugars in plant biomass hydrolysates including cellodextrins, cellobiose, glucose, xylose, and arabinose, are poorly fermented by microbes. The commonly used ethanol-producing microbe Saccharomyces cerevisiae can usually only utilize glucose, although metabolically engineered strains that utilize xylose have been developed. Direct fermentation of cellobiose could avoid glucose repression during biomass fermentation, but applications of an engineered cellobiose-utilizing S. cerevisiae are still limited because of its long lag phase. Bioethanol production from biomass-derived sugars by a cellulolytic filamentous fungus would have many advantages for the biorefinery industry. RESULTS: We selected Myceliophthora thermophila, a cellulolytic thermophilic filamentous fungus for metabolic engineering to produce ethanol from glucose and cellobiose. Ethanol production was increased by 57% from glucose but not cellobiose after introduction of ScADH1 into the wild-type (WT) strain. Further overexpression of a glucose transporter GLT-1 or the cellodextrin transport system (CDT-1/CDT-2) from N. crassa increased ethanol production by 131% from glucose or by 200% from cellobiose, respectively. Transcriptomic alysis of the engineered cellobiose-utilizing strain and WT when grown on cellobiose showed that genes involved in oxidation-reduction reactions and the stress response were downregulated, whereas those involved in protein biosynthesis were upregulated in this effective ethanol production strain. Turning down the expression of pyc gene results the fil engineered strain with the ethanol production was further increased by 23%, reaching up to 11.3 g/L on cellobiose. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first attempt to engineer the cellulolytic fungus M. thermophila to produce bioethanol from biomass-derived sugars such as glucose and cellobiose. The ethanol production can be improved about 4 times up to 11 grams per liter on cellobiose after a couple of genetic engineering. These results show that M. thermophila is a promising platform for bioethanol production from cellulosic materials in the future.

31078793	Direct production of commodity chemicals from lignocellulose using Myceliophthora thermophila	The production of fuels and chemicals from renewable plant biomass has been proposed as a feasible strategy for global sustaible development. However, the economic efficiency of biorefineries is low. Here, through metabolic engineering, Myceliophthora thermophila, a cellulolytic thermophilic fungus, was constructed into a platform that can efficiently convert lignocellulose into important bulk chemicals-four carbon 1, 4-diacids (malic and succinic acid), building blocks for biopolymers-without the need for extra hydrolytic enzymes. Titers of >200鈥痝/L from crystalline cellulose and 110鈥痝/L from plant biomass (corncob) were achieved during fed-batch fermentation. Our study represents a milestone in consolidated bioprocessing technology and offers a new and promising system for the cost-effective production of chemicals and fuels from biomass.

31786675	High-level expression of highly active and thermostable trehalase from Myceliophthora thermophila in Aspergillus niger by using the CRISPR/Cas9 tool and its application in ethanol fermentation	Trehalase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the non-reducing disaccharide trehalose. The highly active trehalase MthT from Myceliophthora thermophila was screened from the trehalase genes of six species of filamentous fungi. An ingenious multi-copy knock-in expression strategy mediated by the CRISPR/Cas9 tool and medium optimization were used to improve MthT production in Aspergillus niger, up to 1698.83 U/mL. The protein background was dramatically abated due to insertion. The recombint MthT showed optimal activity at pH 5.5 and 60  degrees C, and exhibited prominent thermal stability between 50 and 60  degrees C under acid conditions (pH 4.5-6.5). The ethanol conversion rate (ethanol yield/total glucose) was significantly improved by addition of MthT (51.88%) compared with MthT absence (34.38%), using 30% starch saccharification liquid. The results of this study provided an effective strategy, established a convenient platform for heterologous expression in A. niger and showed a potential strategy to decrease production costs in industrial ethanol production.

32253539	Construction of a new thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila platform for enzyme production using a versatile 2A peptide strategy combined with efficient CRISPR-Cas9 system	OBJECTIVE: To construct a new thermophilic platform for glucoamylase production through 2A peptide strategy combined with CRISPR-Cas9 system using Myceliophthora thermophila as host, thermophilic filamentous fungus with industrial attractiveness to produce enzymes and chemicals from biomass. RESULTS: We adapted the viral 2A peptide approach for M. thermophila and constructed a bicistronic vector for co-expressing two heterologous genes MhglaA and egfp. We obtained positive transformants OE-MhglaA-gfp overexpressing MhGlaA-9 xHis-2A-eGFP through convenient fluorescence screening, western blotting and RT-qPCR. We purified and characterized the recombint MhGlaA, which exhibited stability in a broader pH range of 3.0-9.0 and thermostable stability at 65  degrees C, suggesting its potential industrial application. Furthermore, to improve glucoamylase secretion, we genetically engineered the obtained strain OE-MhglaA-gfp through our efficient CRISPR/Cas9 system and generated the quintuple mutant OE-MhglaA-gfpOE-amyRDeltaalp-1Deltares-1Deltacre-1, in which protein productivity and amylase activity were increased by approximately 12.0- and 8.2-fold compared with WT. CONCLUSIONS: The 2A peptide approach worked well in M. thermophila and can be used to heterologously co-express two different proteins, and thus in combition with efficient CRISPR-Cas system will accelerate establishing hyper-secretion platforms for biotechnological applications.	2A peptide, CRISPR-Cas9, Co-expression, MhGlaA, Myceliophthora thermophile, Platform	Biotechnology letters	College of Biotechnology, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin, 300457, China.

32984289	Evaluation of the Enzymatic Arsel Secreted by Myceliophthora thermophila During Growth on Sugarcane Bagasse With a Focus on LPMOs	The high demand for energy and the increase of the greenhouse effect propel the necessity to develop new technologies to efficiently deconstruct the lignocellulosic materials into sugars monomers. Sugarcane bagasse is a rich polysaccharide residue from sugar and alcohol industries. The thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila (syn. Sporotrichum thermophilum) is an interesting model to study the enzymatic degradation of biomass. The genome of M. thermophila encodes an extensive repertoire of cellulolytic enzymes including 23 lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses (LPMOs) from the Auxiliary Activity family 9 (AA9), which are known to oxidatively cleave the beta-1,4 bonds and boost the cellulose conversion in a biorefinery context. To achieve a deeper understanding of the enzymatic capabilities of M. thermophila on sugarcane bagasse, we pretreated this lignocellulosic residue with different methods leading to solids with various cellulose/hemicellulose/lignin proportions and grew M. thermophila on these substrates. The secreted proteins were alyzed using proteomics taking advantage of two mass spectrometry methodologies. This approach unraveled the secretion of many CAZymes belonging to the Glycosyl Hydrolase (GH) and AA classes including several LPMOs that may contribute to the biomass degradation observed during fungal growth. Two AA9 LPMOs, called MtLPMO9B and MtLPMO9H, were selected from secretomic data and enzymatically characterized. Although MtLPMO9B and MtLPMO9H were both active on cellulose, they differed in terms of optimum temperatures and regioselectivity releasing either C1 or C1-C4 oxidized oligosaccharides, respectively. LPMO activities were also measured on sugarcane bagasse substrates with different levels of complexity. The boosting effect of these LPMOs on bagasse sugarcane saccharification by a Trichoderma reesei commercial cocktail was also observed. The partially delignified bagasse was the best substrate considering the oxidized oligosaccharides released and the acid treated bagasse was the best one in terms of saccharification boost.

32653619	Enzymatic versatility and thermostability of a new aryl-alcohol oxidase from Thermothelomyces thermophilus M77	Background Fungal aryl-alcohol oxidases (AAOx) are extracellular flavoenzymes that belong to glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family and are responsible for the selective conversion of primary aromatic alcohols into aldehydes and aromatic aldehydes to their corresponding acids, with concomitant production of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) as by-product. The H(2)O(2) can be provided to lignin degradation pathway, a biotechnological property explored in biofuel production. In the thermophilic fungus Thermothelomyces thermophilus (formerly Myceliophthora thermophila), just one AAOx was identified in the exo-proteome. Methods The glycosylated and non-refolded crystal structure of an AAOx from T. thermophilus at 2.6 A resolution was elucidated by X-ray crystallography combined with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies. Moreover, biochemical alyses were carried out to shed light on enzyme substrate specificity and thermostability. Results This flavoenzyme harbors a flavin adenine dinucleotide as a cofactor and is able to oxidize aromatic substrates and 5-HMF. Our results also show that the enzyme has similar oxidation rates for bulky or simple aromatic substrates such as cinmyl and veratryl alcohols. Moreover, the crystal structure of MtAAOx reveals an open active site, which might explain observed specificity of the enzyme. Conclusions MtAAOx shows previously undescribed structural differences such as a fully accessible catalytic tunnel, heavy glycosylation and Ca(2+) binding site providing evidences for thermostability and activity of the enzymes from AA3_2 subfamily. General significance Structural and biochemical alyses of MtAAOx could be important for comprehension of aryl-alcohol oxidases structure-function relationships and provide additiol molecular tools to be used in future biotechnological applications.

32149262	Lignin-Based Pesticide Delivery System	The potential of lignosulfotes as widely underutilized byproducts of the pulp and paper industry for the synthesis of a biodegradable pesticide carrier system was assessed in this study. Design of experiment software MODDE Pro was for the first time applied to optimize lignosulfote granule production using Myceliophthora thermophila laccase as a biocatalyst. Enzymatic cross-linking was monitored using size exclusion chromatography coupled online to multiangle laser light scattering, viscosity measurement, and enzyme activity. The determined optimal and experimentally confirmed incubation conditions were: 33  degrees C, 30 cm(3)/min O(2) supply, and 190 min reaction time. The granules were thereafter loaded with 2 g/kg 3,6-dichloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid (Dicamba), a broad-spectrum herbicide. According to the HPLC alysis, complete release of Dicamba was achieved after 48 h of release. This study showed the green production of a 100% lignosulfote-based biodegradable solid carrier with potential application in agriculture.

31235519	Substrate selectivity in starch polysaccharide monooxygeses	Degradation of polysaccharides is central to numerous biological and industrial processes. Starch-active polysaccharide monooxygeses (AA13 PMOs) oxidatively degrade starch and can potentially be used with industrial amylases to convert starch into a fermentable carbohydrate. The oxidative activities of the starch-active PMOs from the fungi Neurospora crassa and Myceliophthora thermophila, NcAA13 and MtAA13, respectively, on three different starch substrates are reported here. Using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography coupled with pulsed amperometry detection, we observed that both enzymes have significantly higher oxidative activity on amylose than on amylopectin and cornstarch. Alysis of the product distribution revealed that NcAA13 and MtAA13 more frequently oxidize glycosidic linkages separated by multiples of a helical turn consisting of six glucose units on the same amylose helix. Docking studies identified important residues that are involved in amylose binding and suggest that the shallow groove that spans the active-site surface of AA13 PMOs favors the binding of helical amylose substrates over nonhelical substrates. Truncations of NcAA13 that removed its tive carbohydrate-binding module resulted in diminished binding to amylose, but truncated NcAA13 still favored amylose oxidation over other starch substrates. These findings establish that AA13 PMOs preferentially bind and oxidize the helical starch substrate amylose. Moreover, the product distributions of these two enzymes suggest a unique interaction with starch substrates.	amylose, auxiliary activity (AA) enzyme, carbohydrate-binding protein, copper, copper monooxygese, metalloprotein, oxygese, polysaccharide, polysaccharide monooxygese, starch	The Journal of biological chemistry	Nguyen Tat Thanh Hi-Tech Institute, Nguyen Tat Thanh University, Ho Chi Minh City 70000, Vietnam.

31534479	Myceliophthora thermophila Xyr1 is predomintly involved in xylan degradation and xylose catabolism	BACKGROUND: Myceliophthora thermophila is a thermophilic ascomycete fungus that is used as a producer of enzyme cocktails used in plant biomass saccharification. Further development of this species as an industrial enzyme factory requires a detailed understanding of its regulatory systems driving the production of plant biomass-degrading enzymes. In this study, we alyzed the function of MtXlr1, an ortholog of the (hemi-)cellulolytic regulator XlnR first identified in another industrially relevant fungus, Aspergillus niger. RESULTS: The Mtxlr1 gene was deleted and the resulting strain was compared to the wild type using growth profiling and transcriptomics. The deletion strain was uble to grow on xylan and d-xylose, but showed only a small growth reduction on l-arabinose, and grew similar to the wild type on Avicel and cellulose. These results were supported by the transcriptome alyses which revealed reduction of genes encoding xylan-degrading enzymes, enzymes of the pentose catabolic pathway and putative pentose transporters. In contrast, no or minimal effects were observed for the expression of cellulolytic genes. CONCLUSIONS: Myceliophthora thermophila MtXlr1 controls the expression of xylanolytic genes and genes involved in pentose transport and catabolism, but has no significant effects on the production of cellulases. It therefore resembles more the role of its ortholog in Neurospora crassa, rather than the broader role described for this regulator in A. niger and Trichoderma reesei. By revealing the range of genes controlled by MtXlr1, our results provide the basic knowledge for targeted strain improvement by overproducing or constitutively activating this regulator, to further improve the biotechnological value of M. thermophila.

31407106	Glycosylation influences activity, stability and immobilization of the feruloyl esterase 1a from Myceliophthora thermophila	Heterologous protein production is widely used in industrial biotechnology. However, using non-tive production hosts can lead to enzymes with altered post-translatiol modifications, such as glycosylation. We have investigated how production in a non-tive host affects the physicochemical properties and enzymatic activity of a feruloyl esterase from Myceliophthora thermophila, MtFae1a. The enzyme was produced in two microorganisms that introduce glycosylation (M. thermophila and Pichia pastoris) and in Escherichia coli (non-glycosylated). Mass spectrometric alysis confirmed the presence of glycosylation and revealed differences in the lengths of glycan chains between the enzymes produced in M. thermophila and P. pastoris. The melting temperature and the optimal temperature for activity of the non-glycosylated enzyme were considerably lower than those of the glycosylated enzymes. The three MtFae1a versions also exhibited differences in specific activity and specificity. The catalytic efficiency of the glycosylated enzymes were more than 10 times higher than that of the non-glycosylated one. In biotechnology, immobilization is often used to allow reusing enzyme and was investigated on mesoporous silica particles. We found the binding kinetics and immobilization yield differed between the enzyme versions. The largest differences were observed when comparing enzymes with and without glycosylation, but significant variations were also observed between the two differently glycosylated enzymes. We conclude that the biotechnological value of an enzyme can be optimized for a specific application by carefully selecting the production host.

The polyaniline was produced by in situ green polymerization of aniline by Myceliophthora thermophila laccase at pH = 4, 25 degrees C, in the presence of a mediator, 1-hydroxybenzotriazol (HBT), using two different reactors, a water bath (WB) and an ultrasonic bath (US). MALDI-TOF and 1H NMR characterization of the experiment solutions confirmed the efficient polymerization of aniline by laccase.

31890960	Studies on peroxidase production and detection of Sporotrichum thermophile-like catalase-peroxidase gene in a B acillus species isolated from Hogsback forest reserve, South Africa	This study sought to determine the process conditions for optimum peroxidase production by a B acillus species (Bacillus sp. FALADE-1-KX640922) isolated from Hogsback forest reserve in South Africa and characterize the peroxidase gene in the bacteria. We optimized peroxidase production by manipulating the environmental and nutritiol parameters under submerged fermentation. Subsequently, the gene encoding heme-peroxidase was determined through nested polymerase chain reaction and Sanger D sequencing. The studied bacteria had maximum peroxidase production at pH 8, 30  degrees C and 150 rpm. The addition of guaiacol to lignin fermentation medium enhanced peroxidase production by over 100 % in the studied bacteria. However, the other lignin monomers (veratryl alcohol, vanillin, vanillic acid and ferulic acid) repressed the enzyme activity. Modification of the fermentation medium with ammonium sulphate gave the maximum peroxidase yield (8.87 U mL(-1)). Under the predetermined culture conditions, Bacillus sp. FALADE-1 expressed maximum specific peroxidase activity at 48 h (8.32 U mg(-1)). Interestingly, a search of the sequenced gene in PeroxiBase showed 100% similarity to Sporotrichum thermophile catalase-peroxidase gene (katG), as well, the deduced protein sequence clustered with bacterial catalase-peroxidases and had a molecular weight of about 11.45 kDa with 7.01 as the estimated isoelectric point. Subsequently, the nucleotide sequence was deposited in the tiol Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) repository with the accession number MF407314. In conclusion, Bacillus sp. FALADE-1 is a promising candidate for improved peroxidase production.

30465791	Development of host strains and vector system for an efficient genetic transformation of filamentous fungi	An ability to synthesize extracellular enzymes degrading a wide spectrum of plant and algae polymeric substrates makes many fungi relevant for biotechnology. The terrestrial thermophilic and marine fungal isolates capable of plant and algae degradation have been tested for antibiotic resistance for their possible use in a new genetic transformation system. Plasmids encoding the hygromycin B phosphotransferase (hph) under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, the trpC gene promoter of Aspergillus nidulans, and the Aureobasidium pullulans TEF gene promoter were delivered into the fungal cells by electroporation. The effectiveness of different promoters was compared by transformation and growth of Thermothelomyces thermophila (formerly Myceliophthora thermophila) on the selective medium and by real-time PCR alysis. A highly efficient transformation was observed at an electric-pulse of 8.5鈥痥V/cm by using 10鈥痬ug of D per 1鈥痻鈥10(5) conidia. Although all promoters were capable of hph expression in the Th. thermophila cells, the trpC promoter provided the highest level of hygromycin resistance. We further successfully applied plant biry vector pPZP for co-transformation of hph gene and enhanced green fluorescent protein gene that confirmed this transformation system could be used as an appropriate tool for gene function studies and the expression of heterologous proteins in micromycetes.

31762614	Physical and chemical mutagens improved Sporotrichum thermophile, strain ST20 for enhanced Phytase activity	OBJECTIVE: Phosphorous is an essential micronutrient of plants and involved in critical biological functions. In ture, phosphorous is mostly present in immobilized inorganic mineral and in the fixed organic form including phytic acid and phosphoesteric compounds. However, the bioavailability of bound phosphorous could be enhanced by the use of phosphate solubilizing microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The phytases are widespread in an environment and have been isolated from different sources comprising bacteria and fungi. METHODOLOGY: In current studies, we show the successful use of gamma rays and EMS (Ethyl Methane Sulphote) mutagenesis for enhanced activity of phytases in a fungal strain Sporotrichum thermophile. RESULTS: We report an improved strain ST2 that could produce a clear halo zone around the colony, up to 24鈥痬m. The maximum enzymatic activity was found of 382鈥疷/mL on pH 5.5. However, the phytase activity was improved to 387鈥疷/ml at 45鈥 degrees C. We also report that the mutants produced through EMS showed the greater potential for phytase production. CONCLUSION: The current study highlights the potential of EMS mutagenesis for strain improvement over physical mutagens.

31114738	Enhanced endoxylase production by Myceliophthora thermophila with applicability in saccharification of agricultural substrates	The production of enzymes by solid-state fermentation is an interesting process and currently used worldwide as it can be carried out in solid matrix in absence of free water. In present study, Myceliophthora thermophila BJTLRMDU3 produced high titres of endoxylase (890.55 U/g DR, dry residue) using 5 g rice straw at pH 7.0 and at 45  degrees C with 1:7 (w/v) solid-to-moisture ratio with inoculum rate of 12 x 10(6) spores/ml after 4 days in solid-state fermentation. High enzyme titre was produced after moistening the rice straw with solution containing ammonium sulphate (0.4%), K(2)HPO(4) (1.0%), MgSO(4).7H(2)O (0.3%), FeSO(4).7H(2)O (0.03%) and CaCl(2) (0.03%). Addition of sucrose (2% w/v) and ammonium nitrate (2% w/v) further enhanced the endoxylase production. A high endoxylase production was achieved at water activity (a (W)) of 0.95 (1639.80 U/g DR) that declined drastically below this value. Among different surfactants, Tween 20 (3% v/v) enhanced the secretion of endoxylase (2047.91 U/g DR). Furthermore, on optimization of K(2)HPO(4) concentration, it was found that 0.5% K(2)HPO(4) improved (2191.28 U/g DR) endoxylase production and overall 4.35-folds increase in production of endoxylase was achieved after optimization of culture conditions. The enzyme has potential to liberate monomeric (xylose) as well as oligomeric (xylotiose, xylotetrose, and xylopantose) sugars from xylan. On saccharification of rice straw and corncob with endoxylase, maximum yield of reducing sugars was 135.61 and 132.61 mg/g of substrate recorded after 48, and 36 h, respectively.

31168433	Proteomic profiling of Sporotrichum thermophile under the effect of ionic liquids: manifestation of an oxidative stress response	Sporotrichum thermophile, a known producer of industrial enzymes exhibited stability in the presence of ionic liquids (ILs).The study reports, for the first time, the stress response of S. thermophile upon exposure to ILs. In vitro assay showed increased anti-oxidative enzyme levels indicating ROS-mediated oxidative stress by ILs. The proteomic profile and identification of differential proteins confirmed the fungal adaptations by (i) increased expression of glycolytic enzymes and ATP synthases (ii) downregulation of TCA cycle and protein synthesis machinery components (iii) expression of HSP70 and catalase/peroxidase. These changes are indicative of metabolic regulation of many important pathways and how ILs can be used to manipulate protein behavior.

31110561	A novel fungal GH30 xylase with xylobiohydrolase auxiliary activity	BACKGROUND: The main representatives of hemicellulose are xylans, usually decorated beta-1,4-linked d-xylose polymers, which are hydrolyzed by xylases. The efficient utilization and complete hydrolysis of xylans necessitate the understanding of the mode of action of xylan degrading enzymes. The glycoside hydrolase family 30 (GH30) xylases comprise a less studied group of such enzymes, and differences regarding the substrate recognition have been reported between fungal and bacterial GH30 xylases. Besides their role in the utilization of lignocellulosic biomass for bioenergy, such enzymes could be used for the tailored production of prebiotic xylooligosaccharides (XOS) due to their substrate specificity. RESULTS: The expression of a putative GH30_7 xylase from the fungus Thermothelomyces thermophila (synonyms Myceliophthora thermophila, Sporotrichum thermophile) in Pichia pastoris resulted in the production and isolation of a novel xylase with unique catalytic properties. The novel enzyme desigted TtXyn30A, exhibited an endo- mode of action similar to that of bacterial GH30 xylases that require 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid (MeGlcA) decorations, in contrast to most characterized fungal ones. However, TtXyn30A also exhibited an exo-acting catalytic behavior by releasing the disaccharide xylobiose from the non-reducing end of XOS. The hydrolysis products from beechwood glucuronoxylan were MeGlcA substituted XOS, and xylobiose. The major uronic XOS (UXOS) were the aldotriuronic and aldotetrauronic acid after longer incubation indicating the ability of TtXyn30A to cleave linear parts of xylan and UXOS as well. CONCLUSIONS: Hereby, we reported the heterologous production and biochemical characterization of a novel fungal GH30 xylase exhibiting endo- and exo-xylase activity. To date, considering its novel catalytic properties, TtXyn30A shows differences with most characterized fungal and bacterial GH30 xylases. The discovered xylobiohydrolase mode of action offers new insights into fungal enzymatic systems that are employed for the utilization of lignocellulosic biomass. The recombint xylase could be used for the production of X2 and UXOS from glucuronoxylan, which in turn would be utilized as prebiotics carrying manifold health benefits.

31641526	Practical guidance for the implementation of the CRISPR genome editing tool in filamentous fungi	BACKGROUND: Within the last years, numerous reports described successful application of the CRISPR nucleases Cas9 and Cpf1 for genome editing in filamentous fungi. However, still a lot of efforts are invested to develop and improve protocols for the fungus and genes of interest with respect to applicability, scalability and targeting efficiencies. These efforts are often hampered by the fact that-although many different protocols are available-none have systematically alysed and compared different CRISPR nucleases and different application procedures thereof for the efficiency of single- and multiplex-targeting approaches in the same fungus. RESULTS: We present here data for successful genome editing in the cell factory Thermothelomyces thermophilus, formerly known as Myceliophthora thermophila, using the three different nucleases SpCas9, FnCpf1, AsCpf1 guided to four different gene targets of our interest. These included a polyketide synthase (pks4.2), an alkaline protease (alp1), a SRE protein (snc1) and a potential transcription factor (ptf1). For all four genes, guide Rs were developed which ebled successful single-targeting and multiplex-targeting. CRISPR nucleases were either delivered to T. thermophilus on plasmids or preassembled with in vitro transcribed gR to form ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). We also evaluated the efficiency of single oligonucleotides for site-directed mutagenesis. Filly, we were able to scale down the transformation protocol to microtiter plate format which generated high numbers of positive transformants and will thus pave the way for future high-throughput investigations. CONCLUSION: We provide here the first comprehensive alysis and evaluation of different CRISPR approaches for a filamentous fungus. All approaches followed ebled successful genome editing in T. thermophilus; however, with different success rates. In addition, we show that the success rate depends on the respective nuclease and on the targeted gene locus. We filly present a practical guidance for experimental considerations aiming to guide the reader for successful implementation of CRISPR technology for other fungi.

31890021	Upgrading of efficient and scalable CRISPR-Cas-mediated technology for genetic engineering in thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila	BACKGROUND: Thermophilic filamentous fungus Myceliophthora thermophila has great capacity for biomass degradation and is an attractive system for direct production of enzymes and chemicals from plant biomass. Its industrial importance inspired us to develop genome editing tools to speed up the genetic engineering of this fungus. First-generation CRISPR-Cas9 technology was developed in 2017 and, since then, some progress has been made in thermophilic fungi genetic engineering, but a number of limitations remain. They include the need for complex independent expression cassettes for targeting multiplex genomic loci and the limited number of available selectable marker genes. RESULTS: In this study, we developed an Acidaminococcus sp. Cas12a-based CRISPR system for efficient multiplex genome editing, using a single-array approach in M. thermophila. These CRISPR-Cas12a cassettes worked well for simultaneous multiple gene deletions/insertions. We also developed a new simple approach for marker recycling that relied on the novel cleavage activity of the CRISPR-Cas12a system to make D breaks in selected markers. We demonstrated its performance by targeting nine genes involved in the cellulase production pathway in M. thermophila via three transformation rounds, using two selectable markers neo and bar. We obtained the nonuple mutant M9 in which protein productivity and lignocellulase activity were 9.0- and 18.5-fold higher than in the wild type. We conducted a parallel investigation using our transient CRISPR-Cas9 system and found the two technologies were complementary. Together we called them CRISPR-Cas-assisted marker recycling technology (Camr technology). CONCLUSIONS: Our study described new approaches (Camr technology) that allow easy and efficient marker recycling and iterative stacking of traits in the same thermophilic fungus strain either, using the newly established CRISPR-Cas12a system or the established CRISPR-Cas9 system. This Camr technology will be a versatile and efficient tool for engineering, theoretically, an unlimited number of genes in fungi. We expect this advance to accelerate biotechnology-oriented engineering processes in fungi.

31754437	Dissecting cellobiose metabolic pathway and its application in biorefinery through consolidated bioprocessing in Myceliophthora thermophila	BACKGROUND: Lignocellulosic biomass has long been recognized as a potential sustaible source for industrial applications. The costs associated with conversion of plant biomass to fermentable sugar represent a significant barrier to the production of cost-competitive biochemicals. Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) is considered a potential breakthrough for achieving cost-efficient production of biomass-based fuels and commodity chemicals. During the degradation of cellulose, cellobiose (major end-product of cellulase activity) is catabolized by hydrolytic and phosphorolytic pathways in cellulolytic organisms. However, the details of the two intracellular cellobiose metabolism pathways in cellulolytic fungi remain to be uncovered. RESULTS: Using the engineered malic acid production fungal strain JG207, we demonstrated that the hydrolytic pathway by beta-glucosidase and the phosphorolytic pathway by phosphorylase are both used for intracellular cellobiose metabolism in Myceliophthora thermophila, and the yield of malic acid can benefit from the energy advantages of phosphorolytic cleavage. There were obvious differences in regulation of the two cellobiose catabolic pathways depending on whether M. thermophila JG207 was grown on cellobiose or Avicel. Disruption of Mtcpp in strain JG207 led to decreased production of malic acid under cellobiose conditions, while expression levels of all three intracellular beta-glucosidase genes were significantly up-regulated to rescue the impairment of the phosphorolytic pathway under Avicel conditions. When the flux of the hydrolytic pathway was reduced, we found that beta-glucosidase encoded by bgl1 was the domint enzyme in the hydrolytic pathway and deletion of bgl1 resulted in significant enhancement of protein secretion but reduction of malate production. Combining comprehensive manipulation of both cellobiose utilization pathways and enhancement of cellobiose uptake by overexpression of a cellobiose transporter, the fil strain JG412Deltabgl2Deltabgl3 produced up to 101.2 g/L and 77.4 g/L malic acid from cellobiose and Avicel, respectively, which corresponded to respective yields of 1.35 g/g and 1.03 g/g, representing significant improvement over the starting strain JG207. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of detailed investigation of intracellular cellobiose catabolism in cellulolytic fungus M. thermophila. These results provide insights that can be applied to industrial fungi for production of biofuels and biochemicals from cellobiose and cellulose.

31381927	A lytic polysaccharide monooxygese from Myceliophthora thermophila and its synergism with cellobiohydrolases in cellulose hydrolysis	Lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses (LPMOs) have attracted vast attention because of their unique mechanism of oxidative degradation of carbohydrate polymers and the potential application in biorefineries. This study characterized a novel LPMO from Myceliophthora thermophila, denoted MtLPMO9L. The structure model of the enzyme indicated that it belongs to the C1-oxidizing LPMO, which has neither an extra helix in the L3 loop nor extra loop region in the L2 loop. This was confirmed subsequently by the enzymatic assays since MtLPMO9L only acts on cellulose and generates C1-oxidized cello-oligosaccharides. Moreover, synergetic experiments showed that MtLPMO9L significantly improves the efficiency of cellobiohydrolase (CBH) II. In contrast, the inhibitory rather than synergetic effect was observed when combining used MtLPMO9L and CBHI. Changing the incubation time and concentration ratio of MtLPMO9L and CBHI could attenuate the inhibitory effects. This discovery suggests a different synergy detail between MtLPMO9L and two CBHs, which implies that the composition of cellulase cocktails may need reconsideration.

30474279	CLR-4, a novel conserved transcription factor for cellulase gene expression in ascomycete fungi	Fungal degradation of lignocellulosic biomass requires various (hemi-)cellulases and is an important part of the tural carbon cycle. Although induction of cellulases has been described for some saprobic filamentous fungi, the regulation of cellulase transcription is complex and many aspects are still poorly understood. Here, we identified and characterized the novel cellulase regulation factor NcCLR-4 in Neurospora crassa and its ortholog MtCLR-4 in Myceliophthora thermophila. Deletion of CLR-4 resulted in similarly defective cellulolytic enzyme production and activities. Transcriptome alyses of DeltaNcclr-4/DeltaMtclr-4 revealed the down-regulation of genes encoding (hemi-)cellulases and pivotal regulators (clr-1, clr-2 and xyr-1) and key genes in the cAMP sigling pathway such as adenylate cyclase Nccr-1. Intracellular cAMP levels were markedly lower in DeltaNcclr-4/DeltaMtclr-4 than in wild-type during cellulose utilization. In electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA) and Dse I footprinting assays, NcCLR-4/MtCLR-4 can directly bound to the promoters of Nccr-1/Mtcr-1 (encoding adenylyl cyclase). EMSAs also demonstrated that NcCLR-4/MtCLR-4 could directly bound to clr-1 (encoding a key cellulase regulator), Mtclr-2 and Mtxyr-1 (encoding biomass deconstruction regulators). These findings about the novel cellulase expression regulators NcCLR-4 and MtCLR-4 enrich our understanding of how cellulose degradation is regulated and provide new targets for engineering fungi to deconstruct plant biomass in biorefineries.

30396396	Functiol characterization and comparative alysis of two heterologous endoglucases from diverging subfamilies of glycosyl hydrolase family 45	Lignocellulosic materials are abundant, renewable and are emerging as valuable substrates for many industrial applications such as the production of second-generation biofuels, green chemicals and pharmaceuticals. However, the recalcitrance and the complexity of cell wall polysaccharides require multiple enzymes for their complete conversion to oligo- and monosaccharides. The endoglucases from GH45 family are a small and relatively poorly studied group of enzymes with potential industrial application. The present study reports cloning, heterologous expression and functiol characterization of two GH45 endoglucases from mesophilic fungi Gloeophyllum trabeum (GtGH45) and thermophilic fungi Myceliophthora thermophila (MtGH45), which belong to subfamilies GH45C and GH45A, respectively. Both enzymes have optimal pH 5.0 and melting temperatures (Tm) of 66.0  degrees C and 80.9  degrees C, respectively, as estimated from circular dichroism experiments. The recombint proteins also exhibited different mode of action when incubated with oligosaccharides ranging from cellotriose to cellohexaose, generating mainly cellobiose and cellotriose (MtGH45) or glucose and cellobiose (GtGH45). The MtGH45 did not show activity against oligosaccharides smaller than cellopentaose while the enzyme GtGH45 was able to depolymerize cellotriose, however with lower efficiency when compared to larger oligosaccharides. Furthermore, both GHs45 were stable up to 70  degrees C for 24 h and useful to enhance initial glucan hydrolysis rates during saccharification of sugarcane pith by a mixture of cellulolytic enzymes. Recombint GHs45 from diverging subfamilies stand out for differences in substrate specificity appearing as new tools for preparation of enzyme cocktails used in cellulose hydrolysis.

31131710	Peptides with antioxidant properties identified from casein, whey, and egg albumin hydrolysates generated by two novel fungal proteases	There are many diseases linked to oxidative stress, including cancer. Importantly, endogenous antioxidants are insufficient to protect against this process. Peptides derived from food proteins produced by hydrolysis have been investigated as exogenous antioxidants. The present study aimed to identify novel peptides with antioxidant potential produced from egg and milk proteins hydrolysis with two new fungal proteases isolated from Eupenicillium javanicum and Myceliophthora thermophila. The degree of hydrolysis at several time points was calculated and correlated to DPPH scavenging and metal chelating assays, all hydrolysates presented antioxidant activity. Casein hydrolyzed by the M. thermophila protease showed the best antioxidant activity. The identified sequences showed that the proportions of amino acids that influence antioxidant activity support the antioxidant assay. Our data reveal the conditions necessary for the successful generation of antioxidant peptides using two novel fungal proteases. This opens a potential new avenue for the design and manufacture of antioxidant molecules.

29359934	Chitise Chi1 from Myceliophthora thermophila C1, a Thermostable Enzyme for Chitin and Chitosan Depolymerization	A thermostable Chitise Chi1 from Myceliophthora thermophila C1 was homologously produced and characterized. Chitise Chi1 shows high thermostability at 40  degrees C (>140 h 90% activity), 50  degrees C (>168 h 90% activity), and 55  degrees C (half-life 48 h). Chitise Chi1 has broad substrate specificity and converts chitin, chitosan, modified chitosan, and chitin oligosaccharides. The activity of Chitise Chi1 is strongly affected by the degree of deacetylation (DDA), molecular weight (Mw), and side chain modification of chitosan. Chitise Chi1 releases mainly (Glcc)(2) from insoluble chitin and chito-oligosaccharides with a polymerization degree (DP) ranging from 2 to 12 from chitosan, in a processive way. Chitise Chi1 shows higher activity toward chitin oligosaccharides (Glcc)(4-6) than toward (Glcc)(3) and is ictive for (Glcc)(2). During hydrolysis, oligosaccharides bind at subsites -2 to +2 in the enzyme's active site. Chitise Chi1 can be used for chitin valorisation and for production of chitin- and chito-oligosaccharides at industrial scale.

29196788	Quantification of the catalytic performance of C1-cellulose-specific lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses	Lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses (LPMOs) have recently been shown to significantly enhance the degradation of recalcitrant polysaccharides and are of interest for the production of biochemicals and bioethanol from plant biomass. The copper-containing LPMOs utilize electrons, provided by reducing agents, to oxidatively cleave polysaccharides. Here, we report the development of a beta-glucosidase-assisted method to quantify the release of C1-oxidized gluco-oligosaccharides from cellulose by two C1-oxidizing LPMOs from Myceliophthora thermophila C1. Based on this quantification method, we demonstrate that the catalytic performance of both MtLPMOs is strongly dependent on pH and temperature. The obtained results indicate that the catalytic performance of LPMOs depends on the interaction of multiple factors, which are affected by both pH and temperature.

29943052	beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase MthG from Myceliophthora thermophila C1, a thermostable enzyme for production of N-acetylglucosamine from chitin	Thermostable enzymes are a promising altertive for chemical catalysts currently used for the production of N-acetylglucosamine (Glcc) from chitin. In this study, a novel thermostable beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase MthG was cloned and purified from the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila C1. MthG is a protein with a molecular weight of 71 kDa as determined with MALDI-TOF-MS. MthG has the highest activity at 50  degrees C and pH 4.5. The enzyme shows high thermostability above the optimum temperature: at 55  degrees C (144 h, 75% activity), 60  degrees C (48 h, 85% activity; half-life 82 h), and 70  degrees C (24 h, 33% activity; half-life 18 h). MthG releases Glcc from chitin oligosaccharides (Glcc)(2-5), p-nitrophenol derivatives of chitin oligosaccharides (Glcc)(1-3)-pNP, and the polymeric substrates swollen chitin and soluble chitosan. The highest activity was detected towards (Glcc)(2). MthG released Glcc from the non-reducing end of the substrate. We found that MthG and Chitise Chi1 from M. thermophila C1 synergistically degraded swollen chitin and released Glcc in concentration of approximately 130 times higher than when only MthG was used. Therefore, chitise Chi1 and MthG have great potential in the industrial production of Glcc.

29303991	Characterization of Two VAO-Type Flavoprotein Oxidases from Myceliophthora thermophila	The VAO flavoprotein family consists mostly of oxidoreductases harboring a covalently linked flavin cofactor. The linkage can be either monocovalent at position 8 with a histidine or tyrosine or bicovalent at position 8 with a histidine and at position 6 with a cysteine. Bicovalently bound flavoproteins show a preference for bulkier substrates such as oligosaccharides or secondary metabolites. The genome of the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila C1 was found to be rich in genes encoding putative covalent VAO-type flavoproteins. Enzymes from this fungus have the advantage of being rather thermostable and homologous overexpression in M. thermophila C1 is feasible. Recently we discovered a new and VAO-type carbohydrate oxidase from this fungus: xylooligosaccharide oxidase. In this study, two other putative VAO-type oxidases, protein sequence XP_003663615 (MtVAO615) and XP_003665713 (MtVAO713), were expressed in M. thermophila C1, purified and characterized. Enzyme MtVAO615 was found to contain a bicovalently bound FAD, while enzyme MtVAO713 contained a monocovalent histidyl-bound FAD. The crystal structures of both proteins were obtained which revealed atypical active site architectures. It could be experimentally verified that both proteins, when reduced, rapidly react with molecular oxygen, a hallmark of flavoprotein oxidases. A large panel of alcohols, including carbohydrates, steroids and secondary alcohols were tested as potential substrates. For enzyme MtVAO713 low oxidase activity was discovered towards ricinoleic acid.	bicovalent, crystal structure, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), oxidase	Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)	Molecular Enzymology, Groningen Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology Institute, University of Groningen, 9747AG Groningen, The Netherlands. a.ferrari88@gmail.com.

30966676	Green Binder Based on Enzymatically Polymerized Eucalypt Kraft Lignin for Fiberboard Manufacturing: A Prelimiry Study	The capability of laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila to drive oxidative polymerization of Eucalyptus globulus Kraft lignin (KL) was studied as a previous step before applying this biotechnological approach for the manufacturing of medium-density fiberboards (MDF) at a pilot scale. This method, which improves the self-bonding capacity of wood fibers by lignin enzymatic cross-linking, mimics the tural process of lignification in living plants and trees. An interesting pathway to promote these interactions could be the addition of lignin to the system. The characterization of E. globulus KL after enzymatic treatment showed a decrease of phenolic groups as well as the aromatic protons without loss of aromaticity. There was also an extensive oxidative polymerization of the biomolecule. In the manufacture of self-bonded MDF, the synergy generated by the added lignin and laccase provided promising results. Thus, whenever laccase was present in the treatment, MDF showed an increase in mechanical and dimensiol stability for increasing amounts of lignin. In a pilot scale, this method produced MDF that meets the requirements of the European standards for both thickness swell (TS) and interl bonding (IB) for indoor applications.

29435681	Bio-coloration of bacterial cellulose assisted by immobilized laccase	In this work a process for the bio-coloration of bacterial cellulose (BC) membranes was developed. Laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila was immobilized onto BC membranes and retained up to 88% of residual activity after immobilization. Four compounds belonging to the flavonoids family were chosen to test the in situ polymerase activity of immobilized laccase. All the flavonoids were successfully polymerized by laccase giving rise to yellow, orange and dark brown oligomers which conferred color to the BC support. The optimal bio-coloration conditions were studied for two of the tested flavonoids, catechol and catechin, by varying the concentration and time of incubation. High color depth and resistance to washing were obtained for both compounds. The highly porous bacterial cellulose material demonstrated great performance as a bio-coloration support, in contrast to other materials cited in literature, like cotton or wool. The process developed is presented as an environmentally friendly altertive for bacterial cellulose bio-coloration and will contribute deeply for the development of new fashioble products within this material.

29687143	Evolution of the feruloyl esterase MtFae1a from Myceliophthora thermophila towards improved catalysts for antioxidants synthesis	The chemical syntheses currently employed for industrial purposes, including in the manufacture of cosmetics, present limitations such as unwanted side reactions and the need for harsh chemical reaction conditions. In order to overcome these drawbacks, novel enzymes are developed to catalyze the targeted bioconversions. In the present study, a methodology for the construction and the automated screening of evolved variants library of a Type B feruloyl esterase from Myceliophthora thermophila (MtFae1a) was developed and applied to generation of 30,000 mutants and their screening for selecting the variants with higher activity than the wild-type enzyme. The library was generated by error-prone PCR of mtfae1a cD and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Screening for extracellular enzymatic activity towards 4-nitrocatechol-1-yl ferulate, a new substrate developed ad hoc for high-throughput assays of feruloyl esterases, led to the selection of 30 improved enzyme variants. The best four variants and the wild-type MtFae1a were investigated in docking experiments with hydroxycinmic acid esters using a model of 3D structure of MtFae1a. These variants were also used as biocatalysts in transesterification reactions leading to different target products in detergentless microemulsions and showed enhanced synthetic activities, although the screening strategy had been based on improved hydrolytic activity.

29274421	Immobilization of laccase on epoxy-functiolized silica and its application in biodegradation of phenolic compounds	A novel method of laccase immobilization on epoxy-functiolized silica particles was developed. Laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila was covalently immobilized onto epoxy-functiolized matrix by nucleophilic attack of amino groups of laccase to epoxy groups of the support. The enzyme loading on the support was about 30鈥痬g/g under the optimum conditions (pH 4.5, 24鈥痟). The effect of pH, temperature and organic solvent on immobilized enzyme activity was determined and compared with those of free enzyme. In general the immobilized enzyme was found to be stabilized compared to the free enzyme. Lineweaver-Burk plots were used to calculate kinetic parameters for ABTS oxidation. K(M) values were 24.0 and 25.3鈥痬uM while v(max) values were 10.0 and 1.6鈥痬uM鈥痬in(-1) for free and immobilized laccase, respectively. The performance of the biocatalyst was evaluated by the degradation of phenolic compounds including phenol, p-chlorophenol and catechol. The removal efficiency of catechol by immobilized laccase was about 95% after 2鈥痟.

30125627	Covalent immobilization of laccase by one pot three component reaction and its application in the decolorization of textile dyes	In present study, laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila, was immobilized on epoxy-functiolized silica via one-pot three component reaction as a novel and efficient method for immobilization. The results revealed immobilization of 50鈥痬g of M. thermophila laccase on 1鈥痝 of the supports in presence of cyclohexyl isocyanide after 12鈥痟 of incubation. The immobilized enzyme exhibited notable activity (50鈥疷/g) with improved stability toward pH, temperature and organic solvents.

The results showed that laccase/mediator systems were effective biocatalysts for the treatment of textile dyes.

29678789	Molecular modeling and docking of recombint HAP-phytase of a thermophilic mould Sporotrichum thermophile reveals insights into molecular catalysis and biochemical properties	A thermostable and protease-resistant HAP-phytase of Sporotrichum thermophile was over-expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33. Purified recombint phytase displayed all its biochemical properties similar to wild type. Molecular modeling and docking of phytase with various substrates showed differential binding patterns with GoldScore values ranging from 40.61 to 79.78. Docking with different substrates revealed strong binding affinity with ATP and phytic acid, while the lowest with AMP and phosphoenol pyruvate. This was further confirmed using biochemical assays, as the recombint enzyme displayed broad substrate specificity. Docking with inhibitors also showed differential binding with GoldScore values ranging from 22.94 (2,3-butanedione) to 85.72 (myo-inositol hexasulphate). Validation using biochemical alysis revealed that both 2,3-butanedione and phenyl glyoxal inhibited the phytase activity significantly. Furthermore, presence of inorganic phosphate in the reaction mixture also inhibited the phytase activity, as there was no activity at and beyond 0.8鈥痬M. Docking of phytase with metavadate showed binding at the same atom in the active-site where the substrate i.e. phytic acid binds. Vadium incorporation resulted in the catalytic conversion of phytase into a peroxidase with concomitant inhibition of phytase activity. Peroxidase activity was high in acidic range and the product formation showed correlation with reaction time. Furthermore, molecular modeling and docking of recombint HAP-phytase of a thermophilic mould S. thermophile reveals insights into molecular catalysis that is validated by the biochemical properties.

29887016	Influence of mediators on laccase catalyzed radical formation in lignin	Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) catalyze oxidation of phenolic groups in lignin to phenoxyl radicals during reduction of O(2) to H(2)O. Here, we examine the influence on this radical formation of mediators which are presumed to act by shuttling electrons between the laccase and the subunits in lignin that the enzyme cannot approach directly. Treatments of three different lignins with laccase-mediator-systems (LMS) including laccases derived from Trametes versicolor and Myceliophthora thermophila, respectively, and four individual mediators, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT), N-hydroxyphthalimide (HPI), 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yloxy (TEMPO), and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) were assessed by real time electron paramagnetic resonce measurements. Radical steady state concentrations and radical formation rates were quantified. LMS treatments with 500鈥痬uM N-OH type mediators (HPI or HBT) did not affect the lignin radical formation, but increased doses of those mediators (5鈥痬M) surprisingly led to significantly decreased radical formation rates and lowered steady state radical concentrations. Laccase-TEMPO treatment at a 5鈥痬M mediator dose was the only system that significantly increased steady state radical concentration and rate of radical formation in beech organosolv lignin. The data suggest that electron shuttling by mediators is not a significant general mechanism for enhancing laccase catalyzed oxidation of biorefinery lignin substrates, and the results thus provide a new view on laccase catalyzed lignin modification.

30395580	A comparative structural alysis of the surface properties of asco-laccases	Laccases of different biological origins have been widely investigated and these studies have elucidated fundamentals of the generic catalytic mechanism. However, other features such as surface properties and residues located away from the catalytic centres may also have impact on enzyme function. Here we present the crystal structure of laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila (MtL) to a resolution of 1.62 A together with a thorough structural comparison with other members of the CAZy family AA1_3 that comprises fungal laccases from ascomycetes. The recombint protein produced in A. oryzae has a molecular mass of 75 kDa, a pI of 4.2 and carries 13.5 kDa N-linked glycans. In the crystal, MtL forms a dimer with the phenolic substrate binding pocket blocked, suggesting that the active form of the enzyme is monomeric. Overall, the MtL structure conforms with the canonical fold of fungal laccases as well as the features specific for the asco-laccases. However, the structural comparisons also reveal significant variations within this taxonomic subgroup. Notable differences in the T1-Cu active site topology and polar motifs imply molecular evolution to serve different functiol roles. Very few surface residues are conserved and it is noticeable that they encompass residues that interact with the N-glycans and/or are located at domain interfaces. The N-glycosylation sites are surprisingly conserved among asco-laccases and in most cases the glycan displays extensive interactions with the protein. In particular, the glycans at Asn88 and Asn210 appear to have evolved as an integral part of the asco-laccase structure. An uneven distribution of the carbohydrates around the enzyme give unique properties to a distinct part of the surface of the asco-laccases which may have implication for laccase function-in particular towards large substrates.

28884503	Efficient secretion of three fungal laccases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and their potential for decolorization of textile industry effluent-A comparative study	Laccases are enzymes with a broad range of biotechnological applications and have, for example, the ability to oxidize many xenobiotics including synthetic dyes. In order to obtain an efficient laccase for the decolorization of dyes which spoil wastewater from the textile industry, genes encoding three various laccase enzymes were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The expression of laccases from ascomycete Myceliophthora thermophila (MtL), and two basidiomycetes Trametes versicolor (TvL) and Trametes trogii (TtL) was optimized via selection of plasmids, promoters, media composition, and cultivation conditions. For the first time, the activity of the three secreted laccases was directly compared with the use of various substrates, including different dyes and a wastewater sample. A strong constitutive ADH1 promoter, minimal growth medium, optimized combition of copper and organic nitrogen source, and low cultivation temperature were shown to significantly increase the yields and relative activities of secreted laccases. Heterologous expression of three fungal laccases was successfully achieved in S. cerevisiae being the highest for MtL and the lowest for TvL. MtL, and particularly TtL, showed the decolorization capacity. This is the first report which compared decolorization of synthetic dyes and wastewater by several recombint laccases and suggested MtL and TtL to be applicable in the ecofriendly enzymatic treatment of colored industry effluent.

30555766	Decolorization and detoxification of textile wastewaters by recombint Myceliophthora thermophila and Trametes trogii laccases	Laccases are multi-copper oxidoreductases with broad biotechnological applications. Here, we report detailed biochemical characterization of purified recombint laccases origiting from Myceliophthora thermophila (MtL) and Trametes trogii (TtL). We identified optimal conditions for decolorization of commercial dyes and textile wastewater samples. We also tested the toxicity of decolorized wastewater samples using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. MtL and TtL were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and secreted enzymes were purified by consecutive hydrophobic and gel chromatography. The molecular masses of TtL (~ 65 kDa) and MtL (> 100 kDa) suggested glycosylation of the recombint enzymes. Deglycosylation of MtL and TtL led to 25% and 10% decreases in activity, respectively. In a thermal stability assay, TtL retained 61% and MtL 86% of the initial activity at 40  degrees C. While TtL retained roughly 50% activity at 60  degrees C, MtL lost stability at temperatures higher than 40  degrees C. MtL and TtL preferred syringaldazine as a substrate, and the catalytic efficiencies for ABTS oxidation were 7.5 times lower than for syringaldazine oxidation. In the presence of the mediator HBT, purified TtL almost completely decolorized dyes within 30 min and substantially decolorized wastewater samples from a textile factory (up to 74%) within 20 h. However, products of TtL-catalyzed decolorization were more toxic than MtL-decolorized products, which were almost completely detoxified.

29491860	Characterization of Two Endo-beta-1, 4-Xylases from Myceliophthora thermophila and Their Saccharification Efficiencies, Synergistic with Commercial Cellulase	The xylases with high specific activity and resistance to harsh conditions are of high practical value for biomass utilization. In the present study, two new GH11 xylase genes, MYCTH_56237 and MYCTH_49824, have been cloned from thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The specific activities of purified xylases reach approximately 1,533.7 and 1,412.5 U/mg, respectively. Based on multiple template-based homology modeling, the structures of their catalytic domains are predicted. Enzyme activity was more effective in 7.5 L fermentor, yielding 2,010.4 and 2,004.2 U/mL, respectively. Both enzymes exhibit optimal activity at 60 degrees C with pH of 6.0 and 7.0, respectively. Their activities are not affected by EDTA and an array of metal ions. The kinetic constants have been determined for MYCTH_56237 (K(m) = 8.80 mg/mL, V(max) = 2,380 U/mg) and MYCTH_49824 (K(m) = 5.67 mg/mL, V(max) = 1,750 U/mg). More importantly, both xylases significantly cooperate with the commercial cellulase Celluclast 1.5 L in terms of the saccharification efficiency. All these biochemical properties of the xylases offer practical potential for future applications.

30534201	Metabolic engineering of the thermophilic filamentous fungus Myceliophthora thermophila to produce fumaric acid	BACKGROUND: Fumaric acid is widely used in food and pharmaceutical industries and is recognized as a versatile industrial chemical feedstock. Increasing concerns about energy and environmental problems have resulted in a focus on fumaric acid production by microbial fermentation via bioconversion of renewable feedstocks. Filamentous fungi are the predomint microorganisms used to produce organic acids, including fumaric acid, and most studies to date have focused on Rhizopus species. Thermophilic filamentous fungi have many advantages for the production of compounds by industrial fermentation. However, no previous studies have focused on fumaric acid production by thermophilic fungi. RESULTS: We explored the feasibility of producing fumarate by metabolically engineering Myceliophthora thermophila using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Screening of fumarases suggested that the fumarase from Candida krusei was the most suitable for efficient production of fumaric acid in M. thermophila. Introducing the C. krusei fumarase into M. thermophila increased the titer of fumaric acid by threefold. To further increase fumarate production, the intracellular fumarate digestion pathway was disrupted. After deletion of the two fumarate reductase and the mitochondrial fumarase genes of M. thermophila, the resulting strain exhibited a 2.33-fold increase in fumarate titer. Increasing the pool size of malate, the precursor of fumaric acid, significantly increased the fil fumaric acid titer. Filly, disruption of the malate-aspartate shuttle increased the intracellular malate content by 2.16-fold and extracellular fumaric acid titer by 42%, compared with that of the parental strain. The strategic metabolic engineering of multiple genes resulted in a fil strain that could produce up to 17 g/L fumaric acid from glucose in a fed-batch fermentation process. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first metabolic engineering study on the production of fumaric acid by the thermophilic filamentous fungus M. thermophila. This cellulolytic fungal platform provides a promising method for the sustaible and efficient-cost production of fumaric acid from lignocellulose-derived carbon sources in the future.

29843921	Transcriptiol alysis of Myceliophthora thermophila on soluble starch and role of regulator AmyR on polysaccharide degradation	"Thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila has great capacity for biomass degradation and is an attractive option for use as cell factory to produce chemicals directly from renewable polysaccharides, such as starch, rather than monomer glucose. To date, there has been no transcriptomic alysis of this thermophilic fungus on starch. This study determined the transcriptomic profile of M. thermophila responding to soluble starch and a 342-gene set was identified as a ""starch regulon"", including the major amylolytic enzyme (Mycth_72393). Its overexpression led to increased amylase activities on starch by 35%. Furthermore, overexpressing the key amylolytic enzyme regulator AmyR in M. thermophila significantly increased amylase activity by 30%. Deletion of amyR by the CRISPR/Cas9 system led to the relief of carbon catabolite repression and 3-fold increased lignocellulase activities on cellulose. This study will accelerate ratiol fungal strain engineering for biochemical production from biomass substrates such as raw corn starch and even crop straw."

29527447	A new regulator of cellulase and xylase in the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila strain ATCC 42464	Myceliophthora thermophila (ATCC 42464) is a thermophilic fungus that produces cellulolytic enzymes with high thermal stability. Unlike its mesophile counterparts, study on gene expression regulation of cellulolytic enzymes in M. thermophila is idequate. This work identified the function of MHR1, a putative transcription regulator of cellulolytic enzymes in M. thermophila that was found through R-Seq based gene expression profile alysis. R interference was used to study the role of MHR1. A recombint plasmid, pUC19-Ppdc-mhr1-Tpdc, which contained the Ri sequence for mhr1 was constructed and transformed into M. thermophila. One of the transformants, MtR5, in which the R interference efficiency was the highest, was used for the following studies. In the mhr1-silenced strain MtR5, the filter paper hydrolyzing activity was 1.33-fold; beta-1, 4-endoglucase activity was 1.65-fold; and xylase activity was 1.48-fold higher than those of the parental strain after induction, respectively, by wheat straw powder. qRT-PCR showed that gene expression of cbh1, cbh2, egl3 and xyr1 were 9.56-, 37.36-, 56.14- and 28.30-fold higher in MtR5 than in wild type, respectively. Our findings suggest that the transcription factor MHR1 of M. thermophila can repress cellulase and xylase activities. Silenced mhr1 results in increased expression not only of the main cellulase genes, but also of the positive regulatory gene xyr1. This work is relevant to the development of M. thermophila as an industrial production host for cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes, which could be used to degrade a wide range of different biomass, converting lignocellulosic feedstock into sugar precursors for biofuels.

30961066	Polymers from Bamboo Extracts Produced by Laccase	A green methodology for the production of polymers from bamboo powder was investigated. The optimal conditions for the extraction of components from bamboo were defined by incubating the powder in an acetate buffer (pH 5) under boiling for 2 h. tive laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila was used afterwards to oxidize the extracts from the fil resulting extraction liquid. The reduction of the free OH content after enzymatic oxidation, as well as the (1)H NMR data, confirmed the efficient polymerization of the extracts. The bamboo powder samples were also subjected to high compression and curing, in the absence and in the presence of laccase, to evaluate the hardness of the tablets formed by enzymatic bonding events. The results revealed a higher hardness when the tablets were produced in the presence of laccase, confirming the role of the catalyst on the precipitation of colloidal lignin and phenolic extractives. Herein we produce new oligomers/polymers by laccase oxidation of the extracts resulting from a clean method boiling. At the same time, the data open up new routes for the exploitation of new lignocellulosic materials by the direct application of the enzyme on the bamboo powder material.	bamboo powder, bamboo tablets, laccase, oxidation, phenolic compound extraction	Polymers	International Joint Research Laboratory for Textile and Fiber Bioprocesses, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China. jingsu@ceb.uminho.pt.

30960948	Conductive Cotton by In Situ Laccase-Polymerization of Aniline	Conductive cotton fabrics were obtained via in situ aniline polymerization by laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila under mild reaction conditions without the addition of strong proton acids. The reactions were conducted using two types of reactors, mely a water bath (WB) and an ultrasonic bath (US), and the role of a mediator, 1-hydroxybenzotriazol (HBT), on the laccase-assisted polymerization of aniline was investigated. A similar polymerization degree was obtained when using both reactors-however, the ultrasonic bath allowed the experiments to be conducted in shorter periods of time (24 h for WB vs. 2 h for US). The data obtained also revealed that the mediator (1-hydroxybenzotriazol-HBT) played a crucial role in aniline oxidation. A higher conversion yield and polymerization degree were obtained when the reaction was conducted in the presence of this compound, as confirmed by MALDI-TOF alysis. The cotton fabrics coated with polyaniline presented deep coloration and conductivity, especially when the mediator was included on the reactiol system. The results obtained are a step forward in the enzymatic polymerization of aniline with the purpose of obtaining coloured conductive textile surfaces, with potential applications in wearable electronics.	1-hydroxybenzotriazol (HBT), coatings, conductive cotton, laccase, polyaniline	Polymers	International Joint Research Laboratory for Textile and Fiber Bioprocesses, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China. jingsu@ceb.uminho.pt.

29222836	Biochemical and structural insights into a thermostable cellobiohydrolase from Myceliophthora thermophila	Cellobiohydrolases hydrolyze cellulose, a linear polymer with glucose monomers linked exclusively by beta-1,4 glycosidic linkages. The widespread hydrogen bonding network tethers individual cellulose polymers forming crystalline cellulose, which prevent the access of hydrolytic enzymes and water molecules. The most abundant enzyme secreted by Myceliophthora thermophila M77 in response to the presence of biomass is the cellobiohydrolase MtCel7A, which is composed by a GH7-catalytic domain (CD), a linker, and a CBM1-type carbohydrate-binding module. GH7 cellobiohydrolases have been studied before, and structural models have been proposed. However, currently available GH7 crystal structures only define separate catalytic domains and/or cellulose-binding modules and do not include the full-length structures that are involved in shaping the catalytic mode of operation. In this study, we determined the 3D structure of catalytic domain using X-ray crystallography and retrieved the full-length enzyme envelope via small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) technique. The SAXS data reveal a tadpole-like molecular shape with a rigid linker connecting the CD and CBM. Our biochemical studies show that MtCel7A has higher catalytic efficiency and thermostability as well as lower processivity when compared to the well-studied TrCel7A from Trichoderma reesei. Based on a comparison of the crystallographic structures of CDs and their molecular dymic simulations, we demonstrate that MtCel7A has considerably higher flexibility than TrCel7A. In particular, loops that cover the active site are more flexible and undergo higher conformatiol fluctuations, which might account for decreased processivity and enhanced enzymatic efficiency. Our statistical coupling alysis suggests co-evolution of amino acid clusters comprising the catalytic site of MtCel7A, which correlate with the steps in the catalytic cycle of the enzyme.

30125294	Functiol characterization of a lytic polysaccharide monooxygese from the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila	Thermophilic fungi are a promising source of thermostable enzymes able to hydrolytically or oxidatively degrade plant cell wall components. Among these enzymes are lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses (LPMOs), enzymes capable of enhancing biomass hydrolysis through an oxidative mechanism. Myceliophthora thermophila (synonym Sporotrichum thermophile), an Ascomycete fungus, expresses and secretes over a dozen different LPMOs. In this study, we report the overexpression and biochemical study of a previously uncharacterized LPMO (MtLPMO9J) from M. thermophila M77 in Aspergillus nidulans. MtLPMO9J is a single-domain LPMO and has 63% sequence similarity with the catalytic domain of NcLPMO9C from Neurospora crassa. Biochemical characterization of MtLPMO9J revealed that it performs C4-oxidation and is active against cellulose, soluble cello-oligosaccharides and xyloglucan. Moreover, biophysical studies showed that MtLPMO9J is structurally stable at pH above 5 and at temperatures up to 50 degrees C. Importantly, LC-MS alysis of the peptides after tryptic digestion of the recombintly produced protein revealed not only the correct processing of the sigl peptide and methylation of the N-termil histidine, but also partial autoxidation of the catalytic center. This shows that redox conditions need to be controlled, not only during LPMO reactions but also during protein production, to protect LPMOs from oxidative damage.

29317354	Laccase catalyzed elimition of morphine from aqueous systems	Pharmaceuticals contamite the environment for several reasons, including metabolic excretion after intake, industrial waste and improper disposal. The rcotic drug morphine is commonly utilized for chronic pain magement, and the distribution of morphine in aqueous systems and in waste waters is of high concern. Here, the removal of morphine by a laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila both in its free form as well as immobilized on Accurel MP1000 beads was investigated. Complete morphine elimition was achieved within 30鈥痬in for the free and the immobilized enzyme (70% bound protein) for concentrations between 1 and 1,000鈥痬g鈥疞(-1) according to LC-TOF mass spectrometry alysis. Higher morphine concentrations up to 60鈥痝鈥疞(-1) were also tested and total elimition was achieved within 6 h. Therefore, laccases are ideal candidates for removing morphine from aqueous systems.

28935560	Anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties of laccase-synthesized phenolic-O-carboxymethyl chitosan hydrogels	A bioactive O-carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) hydrogel crosslinked with tural phenolics with potential application in wound dressings was synthesized using a laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila (MTL). The highest degree of cross-linking (49.7%) was achieved with catechol. All the phenolic-CMCS hydrogels synthesized showed excellent anti-oxidant properties with a free radical scavenging activity up to 4-fold higher than in the absence of the phenolics, as quantified by the di(phenyl)-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)iminoazanium (DPPH) assay. In addition, the hydrogels produced showed an anti-inflammatory effect as evidenced by the inhibition of enzymes [myeloperoxidase (MPO), matrix-metalloproteise-1 (MMP-1) and human neutrophil elastase (HNE)] over-expressed in chronic wounds. Sipyl-CMCS hydrogels showed an MMP-1 inhibition of 37%. Further, the phenolic-CMCS hydrogels did not affect the viability of the NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast cell line and were also able to slowly release human fibroblast growth factor 2, reaching 48.3% over a period of 28days. This study thus shows the possibility of synthesizing multifunctiol bioactive chitosan based hydrogels with anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties using tural occurring phenolics as crosslinkers.

28197688	Functiol diversity for biomass deconstruction in family 5 subfamily 5 (GH5_5) of fungal endo-beta1,4-glucases	Endo-beta1,4-glucases in glycosyl hydrolase family 5 (GH5) are ubiquitous enzymes in the multicellular fungi and are common components of enzyme cocktails for biomass conversion. We recently showed that an endo-glucase of subfamily 5 of GH5 (GH5_5) from Sporotrichum thermophile (StCel5A) was more effective at releasing glucose from pretreated corn stover, when part of an eight-component synthetic enzyme mixture, compared to its closely related counterpart from Trichoderma reesei, TrCel5A. StCel5A and TrCel5A belong to different clades of GH5_5 (GH5_5_1 and GH5_5_2, respectively). To test whether the superior activity of StCel5A was a general property of all enzymes in the GH5_5_2 clade, StCel5A, TrCel5A, and two additiol members of each subfamily were expressed in a common host that had been engineered to suppress its tive cellulases (T. reesei Deltaxyr1) and compared against each other alone on pure substrates, in synthetic mixtures on pure substrates, and against each other in synthetic mixtures on real biomass. The results indicated that superiority is a unique property of StCel5A and not of GH5_5_2 generally. The six Cel5A enzymes had significant differences in relative activities on different substrates, in specific activities, and in sensitivities to mann inhibition. Importantly, the behavior of the six endo-glucases on pure cellulose substrates did not predict their behavior in combition with other cellulolytic enzymes on a real lignocellulosic biomass substrate.

28750348	A comparative study on the activity of fungal lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses for the depolymerization of cellulose in soybean spent flakes	Lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses (LPMOs) are copper-dependent enzymes capable of the oxidative breakdown of polysaccharides. They are of industrial interest due to their ability to enhance the enzymatic depolymerization of recalcitrant substrates by glycoside hydrolases. In this paper, twenty-four lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses (LPMOs) expressed in Trichoderma reesei were evaluated for their ability to oxidize the complex polysaccharides in soybean spent flakes, an abundant and industrially relevant substrate. TrCel61A, a soy-polysaccharide-active AA9 LPMO from T. reesei, was used as a benchmark in this evaluation. In total, seven LPMOs demonstrated activity on pretreated soy spent flakes, with the products from enzymatic treatments evaluated using mass spectrometry and high performance anion exchange chromatography. The hydrolytic boosting effect of the top-performing enzymes was evaluated in combition with endoglucase and beta-glucosidase. Two enzymes (TrCel61A and Aspte6) showed the ability to release more than 36% of the pretreated soy spent flake glucose - a greater than 75% increase over the same treatment without LPMO addition.

28257189	The Role of the Secondary Coordition Sphere in a Fungal Polysaccharide Monooxygese	Polysaccharide monooxygeses (PMOs) are secreted metalloenzymes that catalyze the oxidative degradation of polysaccharides in a copper-, oxygen-, and reductant-dependent manner. Cellulose-active fungal PMOs degrade cellulosic substrates to be utilized as a carbon source for fungal growth. To gain insight into the PMO mechanism, the role of conserved residues in the copper coordition sphere was investigated. Here, we report active-site hydrogen-bonding motifs in the secondary copper coordition sphere of MtPMO3*, a C1-oxidizing PMO from the ascomycete fungus Myceliophthora thermophila. A series of point substitutions that disrupt this conserved network are used to interrogate its function. Activity assays, in conjunction with EPR spectroscopy, demonstrate that residues H161 and Q167 are involved in stabilizing bound oxygen, and H161 appears to play a role in proton transfer. Additiolly, Q167 increases the ligand donor strength of Y169 to the copper via a hydrogen-bonding interaction. Altogether, H161 and Q167 are important for oxygen activation, and the results are suggestive of a copper-oxyl active intermediate.

28491137	Boosting LPMO-driven lignocellulose degradation by polyphenol oxidase-activated lignin building blocks	BACKGROUND: Many fungi boost the deconstruction of lignocellulosic plant biomass via oxidation using lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses (LPMOs). The application of LPMOs is expected to contribute to ecologically friendly conversion of biomass into fuels and chemicals. Moreover, applications of LPMO-modified cellulose-based products may be envisaged within the food or material industry. RESULTS: Here, we show an up to 75-fold improvement in LPMO-driven cellulose degradation using polyphenol oxidase-activated lignin building blocks. This concerted enzymatic process involves the initial conversion of monophenols into diphenols by the polyphenol oxidase MtPPO7 from Myceliophthora thermophila C1 and the subsequent oxidation of cellulose by MtLPMO9B. Interestingly, MtPPO7 shows preference towards lignin-derived methoxylated monophenols. Sequence alysis of genomes of 336 Ascomycota and 208 Basidiomycota reveals a high correlation between MtPPO7 and AA9 LPMO genes. CONCLUSIONS: The activity towards methoxylated phenolic compounds distinguishes MtPPO7 from well-known PPOs, such as tyrosises, and ensures that MtPPO7 is an excellent redox partner of LPMOs. The correlation between MtPPO7 and AA9 LPMO genes is indicative for the importance of the coupled action of different monooxygeses in the concerted degradation of lignocellulosic biomass. These results will contribute to a better understanding in both lignin deconstruction and enzymatic lignocellulose oxidation and potentially improve the exploration of eco-friendly routes for biomass utilization in a circular economy.

28515785	Recombint expression of thermostable processive MtEG5 endoglucase and its synergism with MtLPMO from Myceliophthora thermophila during the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic substrates	BACKGROUND: Filamentous fungi are among the most powerful cellulolytic organisms in terrestrial ecosystems. To perform the degradation of lignocellulosic substrates, these microorganisms employ both hydrolytic and oxidative mechanisms that involve the secretion and synergism of a wide variety of enzymes. Interactions between these enzymes occur on the level of saccharification, i.e., the release of neutral and oxidized products, but sometimes also reflected in the substrate liquefaction. Although the synergism regarding the yield of neutral sugars has been extensively studied, further studies should focus on the oxidized sugars, as well as the effect of enzyme combitions on the viscosity properties of the substrates. RESULTS: In the present study, the heterologous expression of an endoglucase (EG) and its combined activity together with a lytic polysaccharide monooxygese (LPMO), both from the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila, are described. The EG gene, belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family 5, was functiolly expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The produced MtEG5A (75 kDa) featured remarkable thermal stability and showed high specific activity on microcrystalline cellulose compared to CMC, which is indicative of its processivity properties. The enzyme was capable of releasing high amounts of cellobiose from wheat straw, birch, and spruce biomass. Addition of MtLPMO9 together with MtEG5A showed enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis yields against regenerated amorphous cellulose (PASC) by improving the release not only of the neutral but also of the oxidized sugars. Assessment of activity of MtEG5A on the reduction of viscosity of PASC and pretreated wheat straw using dymic viscosity measurements revealed that the enzyme is able to perform liquefaction of the model substrate and the tural lignocellulosic material, while when added together with MtLPMO9, no further synergistic effect was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The endoglucase MtEG5A from the thermophilic fungus M. thermophila exhibited excellent properties that render it a suitable candidate for use in biotechnological applications. Its strong synergism with LPMO was reflected in sugars release, but not in substrate viscosity reduction. Based on the level of oxidative sugar formation, this is the first indication of synergy between LPMO and EG reported.

28501686	Immobilisation on mesoporous silica and solvent rinsing improve the transesterification abilities of feruloyl esterases from Myceliophthora thermophila	The immobilisation of four feruloyl esterases (FAEs) (FaeA1, FaeA2, FaeB1, FaeB2) from the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila C1 was studied and optimised via physical adsorption onto various mesoporous silica particles with pore diameters varying from 6.6nm to 10.9nm. Using crude enzyme preparations, enrichment of immobilised FAEs was observed, depending on pore diameter and protein size. The immobilised enzymes were successfully used for the synthesis of butyl ferulate through transesterification of methyl ferulate with 1-butanol. Although the highest butyl ferulate yields were obtained with free enzyme, the synthesis-to-hydrolysis ratio was higher when using immobilised enzymes. Over 90% of the initial activity was observed in a reUSAbility experiment after nine reaction cycles, each lasting 24h. Rinsing with solvent to remove water from the immobilised enzymes further improved their activity. This study demonstrates the suitability of immobilised crude enzyme preparations in the development of biocatalysts for esterification reactions.

28078397	Optimized synthesis of novel prenyl ferulate performed by feruloyl esterases from Myceliophthora thermophila in microemulsions	Five feruloyl esterases (FAEs; EC 3.1.1.73), FaeA1, FaeA2, FaeB1, and FaeB2 from Myceliophthora thermophila C1 and MtFae1a from M. thermophila ATCC 42464, were tested for their ability to catalyze the transesterification of vinyl ferulate (VFA) with prenol in detergentless microemulsions. Reaction conditions were optimized investigating parameters such as the medium composition, the substrate concentration, the enzyme load, the pH, the temperature, and agitation. FaeB2 offered the highest transesterification yield (71.5 +/- 0.2%) after 24 h of incubation at 30  degrees C using 60 mM VFA, 1 M prenol, and 0.02 mg FAE/mL in a mixture comprising of 53.4:43.4:3.2 v/v/v n-hexane:t-butanol:100 mM MOPS-OH, pH 6.0. At these conditions, the competitive side hydrolysis of VFA was 4.7-fold minimized. The ability of prenyl ferulate (PFA) and its corresponding ferulic acid (FA) to scavenge 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals was significant and similar (IC(50) 423.39 muM for PFA, 329.9 muM for FA). PFA was not cytotoxic at 0.8-100 muM (IC(50) 220.23 muM) and reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human skin fibroblasts at concentrations ranging between 4 and 20 muM as determined with the dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay.

28649275	Magement of enzyme diversity in high-performance cellulolytic cocktails	BACKGROUND: Modern biorefineries require enzymatic cocktails of improved efficiency to generate fermentable sugars from lignocellulosic biomass. Cellulolytic fungi, among other microorganisms, have demonstrated the highest potential in terms of enzymatic productivity, complexity and efficiency. On the other hand, under cellulolytic-inducing conditions, they often produce a considerable diversity of carbohydrate-active enzymes which allow them to adapt to changing environmental conditions. However, industrial conditions are fixed and adjusted to the optimum of the whole cocktail, resulting in underperformance of individual enzymes. RESULTS: One of these cellulolytic cocktails from Myceliophthora thermophila has been alyzed here by means of LC-MS/MS. Pure GH6 family members detected have been characterized, confirming previous studies, and added to whole cocktails to compare their contribution in the hydrolysis of industrial substrates. Filly, independent deletions of two GH6 family members, as an example of the enzymatic diversity magement, led to the development of a strain producing a more efficient cellulolytic cocktail. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the deletion of noncontributive cellulases (here EG VI) can increase the cellulolytic efficiency of the cocktail, validating the magement of cellulase diversity as a strategy to obtain improved fungal cellulolytic cocktails.

28710860	Coupling the pretreatment and hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass by the expression of beta-xylosidases	Thermochemical pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis are the areas contributing most to the operatiol costs of second generation ethanol in lignocellulosic biorefineries. The improvement of lignocellulosic enzyme cocktails has been significant in the recent years. Although the needs for the reduction of the energy intensity and chemical consumption in the pretreatment step are well known, the reduction of the severity of the process strongly affects the enzymatic hydrolysis yield. To explore the formulation requirements of the well known cellulolytic cocktail from Myceliophthora thermophila on mild pretreated raw materials, this cocktail was tested on steam exploded corn stover without acid impregtion. The low hemicellulose yield and significant accumulation of xylobiose compared with the standard pretreated material obtained with dilute acid impregtion evidenced a clear limitation in the conversion of xylan to xylose. In order to complement the beta-xylosidase limitation, a selection of enzymes was expressed and tested in this fungus. A controlled expression of xylosidases from Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and FUSArium oxysporum allowed recovering hemicellulose yields reached with standard acid treated material. The results underline the need of parallel development of the pretreatment process with the optimization of the formulation of the enzymatic cocktails.	beta-xylosidase, biofuels, biorefinery, enzymatic hydrolysis, lignocellulosic biomass	Biotechnology and bioengineering	Department of Biotechnology, Abengoa Research, Campus Palmas Altas, Seville, Spain.

28777990	Additives enhancing enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass	Linked to the development of cellulolytic enzyme cocktails from Myceliophthora thermophila, we studied the effect of different additives on the enzymatic hydrolysis yield. The hydrolysis of pretreated corn stover (PCS), sugar cane straw (PSCS) and microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel) was performed under industrial conditions using high solid loadings, limited mixing, and low enzyme dosages. The addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG4000) allowed to increase the glucose yields by 10%, 7.5%, and 32%, respectively in the three materials. PEG4000 did not have significant effect on the stability of the main individual enzymes but increased beta-glucosidase and endoglucase activity by 20% and 60% respectively. Moreover, the presence of PEG4000 accelerated cellulase-catalyzed hydrolysis reducing up to 25% the liquefaction time. However, a prelimiry economical assessment concludes that even with these improvements, a lower contribution of PEG4000 to the 2G bioethanol production costs would be needed to reach commercial feasibility.

28805314	Evolved alpha-factor prepro-leaders for directed laccase evolution in Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Although the functiol expression of fungal laccases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has proven to be complicated, the replacement of sigl peptides appears to be a suitable approach to enhance secretion in directed evolution experiments. In this study, twelve constructs were prepared by fusing tive and evolved alpha-factor prepro-leaders from S. cerevisiae to four different laccases with low-, medium- and high-redox potential (PM1L from basidiomycete PM1; PcL from Pycnoporus cinbarinus; TspC30L from Trametes sp. strain C30; and MtL from Myceliophthora thermophila). Microcultures of the prepro-leader:laccase fusions were grown in selective expression medium that used galactose as both the sole carbon source and as the inducer of expression so that the secretion and activity were assessed with low- and high-redox potential mediators in a high-throughput screening context. With total activity improvements as high as sevenfold over those obtained with the tive alpha-factor prepro-leader, the evolved prepro-leader from PcL (alpha(PcL) ) most strongly enhanced secretion of the high- and medium-redox potential laccases PcL, PM1L and TspC30L in the microtiter format with an expression pattern driven by prepro-leaders in the order alpha(PcL)  > alpha(PM)(1L)  ~ alpha(tive) . By contrast, the pattern of the low-redox potential MtL was alpha(tive)  > alpha(PcL)  > alpha(PM)(1L) . When produced in flask with rich medium, the evolved prepro-leaders outperformed the alpha(tive) sigl peptide irrespective of the laccase attached, enhancing secretion over 50-fold. Together, these results highlight the importance of using evolved alpha-factor prepro-leaders for functiol expression of fungal laccases in directed evolution campaigns.

32624738	Ultrasound-assisted swelling of bacterial cellulose	Bacterial cellulose (BC) was obtained by static cultivation using commercial BC gel from scoby. BC membranes (oven dried and freeze-dried) were swelled with 8% OH, in the absence and in the presence of ultrasound (US), for 30, 60, and 90 min. The influence of swelling conditions on both physico-chemical properties and molecules entrapment was evaluated. Considering the highest levels of entrapment, an optimum swelling procedure was established: 8% OH for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of US. tive and PEGylated laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila was immobilized on BC membranes and a different catalytic behaviour was observed after immobilization. tive laccase presented activity values similar to published reports (5-7 U/gBC) after immobilization whereas PEGylated enzymes showed much lower activity (1-2 U/gBC). BC swelled membranes are presented herein as a potential support for the preparation of immobilized enzymes for industrial applications, like phenolics polymerization.

29100178	Monitoring of reactions catalyzed by lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses using highly-sensitive fluorimetric assay of the oxygen consumption rate	Lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses (LPMOs) are recently discovered enzymes that catalyze the oxidative deconstruction of polysaccharides. However fast and reliable methods of determition of LPMO activity still need to be developed, especially those based on the initial reaction rates. A method based on the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) measurements, using a Seahorse XFp Alyzer with highly-sensitive fluorimetric sensors, was applied for monitoring the oxidation of amorphous cellulose by three fungal LPMOs: recombint enzymes from Thielavia terrestris (GH61E), Trichoderma reesei (Cel61A), and a tive LPMO9A from Myceliophthora thermophila. The turnover numbers for 4 muM enzymes acting on 4 mg mL(-1) cellulose at 37  degrees C were 0.88, 1.26 and 0.93 min(-1), respectively. A possibility of feeding the dissolved reagents into the reaction system during measurements with obtaining a simultaneous response in the OCR allowed in situ monitoring the LPMO inhibition and activation by EDTA and Cu(2+) ions as well as studying other effects on the enzymatic reaction.

27856189	N-Linked glycans are an important component of the processive machinery of cellobiohydrolases	Cellobiohydrolases (CBHs), belonging to glycoside hydrolase families 6 and 7 (GH6 and GH7), are the major components of cellulase systems of filamentous fungi involved in biodegradation of cellulose in ture. Previous studies demonstrated that N-linked glycans in the catalytic domains of GH7 CBHs significantly affect the enzyme activity against cellulosic substrates. The influence of N-linked glycans on the activity and processivity of recombint GH6 CBH II from Penicillium verruculosum (PvCel6A) was studied using site-directed mutagenesis of the respective Asn residues. Depending on the position of N-glycans on the surface of a protein globule, they affected the enzyme activity against cellulose either negatively or positively. The decrease or increase in the degree of processivity of recombint forms of PvCel6A generally correlated with activity changes against Avicel. The mechanism of the N-glycan influence seems to be universal for GH6 and GH7 CBHs. The observed effects for CBHs from both families are explained in terms of a mechanistic model that also makes clear our previously published data on the highly active CBH IIb from Myceliophthora thermophila (MtCel6B). This study, together with data of other researchers, strongly suggests that the N-linked glycans in the catalytic domains of GH6 and GH7 CBHs are involved in processive catalytic machinery of these enzymes. Data obtained should be taken into account during development of new and more effective biocatalysts by protein engineering techniques.

28591592	Recombint thermo-alkali-stable endoglucase of Myceliopthora thermophila BJA (rMt-egl): Biochemical characteristics and applicability in enzymatic saccharification of agro-residues	Codon adaptation index (CAI) of a 1263bp long endoglucase encoding gene from the thermophilic mould Myceliopthora thermophile BJA has been improved from 0.44 to 0.76 by in vitro gene synthesis. The codon optimized endoglucase gene (Mt-egl) has been constitutively expressed in Pichia pastoris under the regulation of GAP promoter. Recombint endoglucase (rMt-egl), purified by size exclusion chromatography, has been confirmed to be a monomeric protein of  approximately 47kDa. rMt-egl is optimally active at pH 10 and 50 degrees C, displaying stability in broad pH and temperature ranges, with a t(1/2) of 60 and 15min at 90 and 100 degrees C, respectively. This retained  approximately 70% of activity after 3h incubation at pH 5-12. The K(m), V(max), k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m) of rMt-egl were 5mgmL(-1), 20mumolesmin(-1)mg(-1), 1.02x10(3)s(-1) and 204s(-1)mg(-1)mL(-1), respectively. Homology modeling and bioinformatics alysis confirmed catalytically important role of glutamate 234 and 344. rMt-egl released high amounts of reducing sugars from wheat bran and corn cobs (421 and 382mgg(-1)), thus making it a useful biocatalyst for producing bioethanol and fine chemicals from agro-residues.

27697488	Bioprocess for the production of recombint HAP phytase of the thermophilic mold Sporotrichum thermophile and its structural and biochemical characteristics	Thermophilc mold Sporotrichum thermophile secretes an acidstable and thermostable phytase, which finds application as a food and feed additive because of its adequate thermostability, acid stability, protease insensitivity and broad substrate spectrum. Low extracellular phytase production by the mold is a major bottleneck for its application on a commercial scale. We have successfully overcome this problem by constitutive secretary expression of codon optimized rStPhy under glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogese (GAP) promoter in Pichia pastoris. A  approximately 41-fold improvement in rStPhy production has been achieved. Circular Dichroism (CD) spectra revealed that rStPhy is composed of 26.65% alpha-helices, 5.26% beta-sheets and 68.09% random coils at pH 5.0 and 60 degrees C, the optima for the enzyme activity. The melting temperature (T(m)) of the enzyme is  approximately 73 degrees C. The 3D structure of rStPhy displayed characteristic sigture sequences (RHGXRXP and HD) of HAP phytase. The catalytically important amino acids (Arg74, His75, Arg78, His368 and Asp369) were identified by docking and site directed mutagenesis. Fluorescence quenching by N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and CsCl exposed tryptophan residues surrounded by negative charges, which play a key role in maintaining structural integrity of rStPhy.

28466305	Concomitant production of cellulase and xylase by thermophilic mould Sporotrichum thermophile in solid state fermentation and their applicability in bread making	Sporotrichum thermophile BJAMDU5 secreted high titres of xylanolytic and cellulolytic enzymes in solid state fermentation using mixture of wheat straw and cotton oil cake (ratio 1:1) at 45  degrees C, pH 5.0 after 72 h inoculated with 2.9 x 10(7) CFU/mL conidiospores. Supplementation of solid medium with lactose and ammonium sulphate further enhanced the production of hydrolytic enzymes. Among different surfactants studied, Tween 80 enhanced the production of all enzymes [3455 U/g DMR (dry mouldy residue), 879.26 U/g DMR, 976.28 U/g DMR and 35.10 U/g DMR for xylase, CMCase (Carboxymethylcellulase), FPase (Filter paper activity) and beta-glucosidase, respectively] as compared to other surfactants. Recycling of solid substrate reduced the production of all these enzymes after second cycle. End products alysis by TLC showed the ability of hydrolytic enzymes of S. thermophile to liberate monomeric (xylose and glucose) as well as oligomeric (xylobiose, cellobiose and higher ones) sugars. Supplementation of enzyme resulted in improved nutritiol properties of the bread. Formation of oligomeric sugars by xylase enzyme of S. thermophile BJAMDU5 make it a good candidate in food industry.

Phytase production by Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis JJBS250 isolated from soil sample was optimized in submerged fermentation using statistical tools. Among all the culture variables tested, sucrose, sodium phytate and Tween-80 were identified as the most significant variables using the Placket-Burman design. Further optimization of these variables resulted in a 6.79-fold improvement in phytase production (7170 U/L) as compared to unoptimized medium.

28576392	Enzymatic tailoring of oleuropein from Olea europaea leaves and product identification by HRMS/MS spectrometry	Oleuropein, a bioactive compound found in all parts of olive tree, especially in leaves and branches, presents numerous health promoting properties that increase research and market interest the last few years. In addition, oleuropein degradation products, such as hydroxytyrosol, elenolic acid, and the aglycones also exhibit biological activities with different properties compared to the starting compound. Under this view, a commercial lipase preparation Lipolase 100L and a thermophilic beta-glucosidase from Myceliophthora thermophila were used for the regioselective hydrolysis of oleuropein towards the production of the corresponding biologically active compounds. The enzymatic degradation products of oleuropein, such as hydroxytyrosol, elenolic acid and its glucoside, and oleuropein aglycones were identified by LC-HRMS/MS and NMR spectroscopy. The latter, was found as a mix of diastereomers of the monoaldehydic form of oleuropein aglycone, identified as (5S, 8R, 9S)-, (5S, 8S, 9S)- and (5S, 8R, 9R). The high substrate specificity exhibited by both lipase and beta-glucosidase allows the successful tailoring of oleuropein towards the production of different biologically active compounds with significant potential in the cosmeceutical and food industry.

28688965	Kinetic and amperometric study of the MtPerII peroxidase isolated from the ascomycete fungus Myceliophthora thermophila	The enzyme MtPerII is a new peroxidase which has been isolated only recently from fungus Myceliophthora thermophila and has significant thermostability and stability at high H(2)O(2) concentrations. In the present work, an electrochemical kinetic study, based on cyclic voltammetry, is performed for the first time for the catalytic decomposition of H(2)O(2) by MtPerII, at 18 degrees C. Leuco methylene blue (LMB) is used as a mediator and the catalytic and Michaelis constants are determined, assuming a Michaelis-Menten mechanism. Experimental evidence suggest the absence of inhibition by H(2)O(2), for concentrations up to 16mM, and increasing catalytic activity for temperatures up to 50 degrees C. Moreover, a modified electrode is constructed, by attempting the entrapment of MtPerII on a dodecanothiol self-assembled monolayer on gold. The modified electrode is studied chronoamperometrically in solutions containing methylene blue mediator and different concentrations of H(2)O(2). It is shown that adsorbed MtPerII retains its activity and the modified electrode exhibits a considerably high linear region for the detection of H(2)O(2). The experimental findings indicate that MtPerII is a new candidate for alytical and industrial applications.

28648174	Functiolization of pectin with laccase-mediated oxidation products of ferulic acid	Pectin is a tural biopolymer extracted mostly from citrus peel, sugar beet and apple pomace. In order to improve its functiol properties and then to enlarge the field of its potential applications, functiolization reaction of citrus pectin with ferulic acid (FA)-oxidation products was performed in aqueous medium, at 30 degrees C and pH7.5, in the presence of Myceliophthora thermophila laccase as biocatalyst. The conjugation between FA-oxidation products and pectin was confirmed using FTIR, UV-Vis and LC-MS alyses. The obtained results suggested that covalent bonds were between the pectin carboxyl groups and FA-oxidation products between the pectin carboxyl groups and FA-oxidation products. The determition of the total phenolic content showed that the modified pectin contained 5 times more phenols than the tive pectin. In view of these results, this enzymatic procedure appears as a promising way to provide new pectin-based polymers that are expected to present new properties of interest.

28859815	Direct rate assessment of laccase catalysed radical formation in lignin by electron paramagnetic resonce spectroscopy	Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) catalyse removal of an electron and a proton from phenolic hydroxyl groups, including phenolic hydroxyls in lignins, to form phenoxy radicals during reduction of O(2). We employed electron paramagnetic resonce spectroscopy (EPR) for real time measurement of such catalytic radical formation activity on three types of lignin (two types of organosolv lignin, and a lignin rich residue from wheat straw hydrolysis) brought about by two different fungal laccases, derived from Trametes versicolor (Tv) and Myceliophthora thermophila (Mt), respectively. Laccase addition to suspensions of the individual lignin samples produced immediate time and enzyme dose dependent increases in intensity in the EPR sigl with g-values in the range 2.0047-2.0050 allowing a direct quantitative monitoring of the radical formation and thus allowed laccase enzyme kinetics assessment on lignin. The experimental data verified that the laccases acted upon the insoluble lignin substrates in the suspensions. When the action on the lignin substrates of the two laccases were compared on equal enzyme dosage levels (by activity units on syringaldazine) the Mt laccase exerted a significantly faster radical formation than the Tv laccase on all three types of lignin substrates. When comparing the equal laccase dose rates on the three lignin substrates the enzymatic radical formation rate on the wheat straw lignin residue was consistently higher than those of the organosolv lignins. The pH-temperature optimum for the radical formation rate in organosolv lignin was determined by response surface methodology to pH 4.8, 33 degrees C and pH 5.8, 33 degrees C for the Tv laccase and the Mt laccase, respectively. The results verify direct radical formation action of fungal laccases on lignin without addition of mediators and the EPR methodology provides a new type of enzyme assay of laccases on lignin.

28053662	Development of a genome-editing CRISPR/Cas9 system in thermophilic fungal Myceliophthora species and its application to hyper-cellulase production strain engineering	BACKGROUND: Over the past 3 years, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has revolutionized the field of genome engineering. However, its application has not yet been validated in thermophilic fungi. Myceliophthora thermophila, an important thermophilic biomass-degrading fungus, has attracted industrial interest for the production of efficient thermostable enzymes. Genetic manipulation of Myceliophthora is crucial for metabolic engineering and to unravel the mechanism of lignocellulose deconstruction. The lack of a powerful, versatile genome-editing tool has impeded the broader exploitation of M. thermophila in biotechnology. RESULTS: In this study, a CRISPR/Cas9 system for efficient multiplexed genome engineering was successfully developed in the thermophilic species M. thermophila and M. heterothallica. This CRISPR/Cas9 system could efficiently mutate the imported amdS gene in the genome via NHEJ-mediated events. As a proof of principle, the genes of the cellulase production pathway, including cre-1, res-1, gh1-1, and alp-1, were chosen as editing targets. Simultaneous multigene disruptions of up to four of these different loci were accomplished with neomycin selection marker integration via a single transformation using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Using this genome-engineering tool, multiple strains exhibiting pronounced hyper-cellulase production were generated, in which the extracellular secreted protein and lignocellulase activities were significantly increased (up to 5- and 13-fold, respectively) compared with the parental strain. CONCLUSIONS: A genome-wide engineering system for thermophilic fungi was established based on CRISPR/Cas9. Successful expansion of this system without modification to M. heterothallica indicates it has wide adaptability and flexibility for use in other Myceliophthora species. This system could greatly accelerate strain engineering of thermophilic fungi for production of industrial enzymes, such as cellulases as shown in this study and possibly bio-based fuels and chemicals in the future.

28278111	Box-Behnken alysis and storage of spray-dried collagenolytic proteases from Myceliophthora thermophila submerged bioprocess	Enzymes do not have long-term storage stability in soluble forms, thus drying methods could minimize the loss of enzymatic activity, the spray dryer removes water under high temperatures and little time. The aims of this study were to improve the stability of enzymatic extract from Myceliophthora thermophila for potential applications in industry and to evaluate the best conditions to remove the water by spray drying technique. The parameters were tested according to Box-Behnken and evaluated by alysis of variance (ANOVA), all the parameters measured were found to influence the fil enzyme activity and spray drying process yield ranged from 38.65 to 63.75%. Enzyme powders showed increased storage stability than extract and maintained about 100% of collagenolytic activity after 180 days of storage at 30 degrees C. The results showed that the microbial enzymes maintained activity during the spray drying process and were stable during long-term storage; these are promising characteristics for industrial applications.

28477154	Thermostable multifunctiol GH74 xyloglucase from Myceliophthora thermophila: high-level expression in Pichia pastoris and characterization of the recombint protein	A xyloglucase of the GH74 family was identified in the thermophilic fungus strain Myceliophthora thermophila VKPM F-244, and its gene sequence was optimized for cloning and expression in Pichia pastoris. The recombint xyloglucase MtXgh74 exhibited the highest activity toward tamarind seed xyloglucan with a K (M) value of 0.51 +/- 0.06 mg/mL. The activities on barley beta-glucan and carboxymethylcellulose were about 4 and 2%, respectively, compared to xyloglucan. Maximum xyloglucase activity was observed at 70-75  degrees C and pH 6.5. After pre-incubation at 50  degrees C, pH 6.0 for 3 h, the enzyme retained 100% of its activity. The half-life of MtXgh74 at 60  degrees C, pH 6.0 was 40 min. In P. pastoris, MtXgh74 was produced in glycosylated form. The enzyme production in a 1 L bioreactor resulted in a yield of 118 U/mL or 5.3 g/L after 51 h fermentation. Kinetic studies of the hydrolysis product formation suggest that MtXgh74 has an endo-processive mode of action. The fil products were the standard xyloglucan building blocks XXXG, XXLG, XLXG, and XLLG. Additiolly, MtXgh74 hydrolyzed various linkages within the xyloglucan building blocks XXXG, XXLG, and XLXG (except XLLG) producing diverse low molecular weight oligosaccharides which may be identified by MALDI-TOF as XG, XX, XXG/GXX/XGX, XXX, LG, LX/XL, XLX/XXL, LLG, GXXXG, GXLLG, XLLGX. The unique combition of different activities within one enzyme along with its high thermostability and specificity toward xyloglucan makes MtXgh74 a promising candidate enzyme for industrial applications.

30023729	Expression, Purification, and Biochemical Characterization of the Flavocytochrome P450 CYP505A30 from Myceliophthora thermophila	The cytochrome P450/P450 reductase fusion enzyme CYP505A30 from the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila and its heme (P450) domain were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using affinity, ion exchange, and size exclusion chromatography. CYP505A30 binds straight chain fatty acids (from  approximately C10 to C20), with highest affinity for tridecanoic acid (K(D) = 2.7 muM). Reduced nicotimide adenine dinucleotide phosphate is the preferred reductant for CYP505A30 (K(M) = 3.1 muM compared to 330 muM for reduced nicotimide adenine dinucleotide in cytochrome c reduction). Electron paramagnetic resonce confirmed cysteine thiolate coordition of heme iron in CYP505A30 and its heme domain. Redox potentiometry revealed an unusually positive midpoint potential for reduction of the flavin adenine dinucleotide and flavin mononucleotide cofactors (E(0)'  approximately  -118 mV), and a large increase in the CYP505A30 heme domain Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox couple (ca. 230 mV) on binding arachidonic acid substrate. This switch brings the ferric heme iron potential into the same range as that of the reductase flavins. Multiangle laser light scattering alysis revealed CYP505A30's ability to dimerize, whereas the heme domain is monomeric. These data suggest CYP505A30 may function catalytically as a dimer (as described for Bacillus megaterium P450 BM3), and that binding interactions between CYP505A30 heme domains are not required for dimer formation. CYP505A30 catalyzed hydroxylation of straight chain fatty acids at the omega-1 to omega-3 positions, with a strong preference for omega-1 over omega-3 hydroxylation in the oxidation of dodecanoic and tetradecanoic acids (88 vs 2% products and 63 vs 9% products, respectively). CYP505A30 has important structural and catalytic similarities to P450 BM3 but distinct regioselectivity of lipid substrate oxidation with potential biotechnological applications.

27588039	Lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses from Myceliophthora thermophila C1 differ in substrate preference and reducing agent specificity	BACKGROUND: Lytic polysaccharide monooxgygeses (LPMOs) are known to boost the hydrolytic breakdown of lignocellulosic biomass, especially cellulose, due to their oxidative mechanism. For their activity, LPMOs require an electron donor for reducing the divalent copper cofactor. LPMO activities are mainly investigated with ascorbic acid as a reducing agent, but little is known about the effect of plant-derived reducing agents on LPMOs activity. RESULTS: Here, we show that three LPMOs from the fungus Myceliophthora thermophila C1, MtLPMO9A, MtLPMO9B and MtLPMO9C, differ in their substrate preference, C1-/C4-regioselectivity and reducing agent specificity. MtLPMO9A generated C1- and C4-oxidized, MtLPMO9B C1-oxidized and MtLPMO9C C4-oxidized gluco-oligosaccharides from cellulose. The recently published MtLPMO9A oxidized, next to cellulose, xylan, beta-(1 --> 3, 1 --> 4)-glucan and xyloglucan. In addition, MtLPMO9C oxidized, to a minor extent, xyloglucan and beta-(1 --> 3, 1 --> 4)-glucan from oat spelt at the C4 position. In total, 34 reducing agents, mainly plant-derived flavonoids and lignin-building blocks, were studied for their ability to promote LPMO activity. Reducing agents with a 1,2-benzenediol or 1,2,3-benzenetriol moiety gave the highest release of oxidized and non-oxidized gluco-oligosaccharides from cellulose for all three MtLPMOs. Low activities toward cellulose were observed in the presence of monophenols and sulfur-containing compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Several of the most powerful LPMO reducing agents of this study serve as lignin building blocks or protective flavonoids in plant biomass. Our findings support the hypothesis that LPMOs do not only vary in their C1-/C4-regioselectivity and substrate specificity, but also in their reducing agent specificity. This work strongly supports the idea that the activity of LPMOs toward lignocellulosic biomass does not only depend on the ability to degrade plant polysaccharides like cellulose, but also on their specificity toward plant-derived reducing agents in situ.

26909078	Development of Thermophilic Tailor-Made Enzyme Mixtures for the Bioconversion of Agricultural and Forest Residues	"Even though the main components of all lignocellulosic feedstocks include cellulose, hemicellulose, as well as the protective lignin matrix, there are some differences in structure, such as in hardwoods and softwoods, which may influence the degradability of the materials. Under this view, various types of biomass might require a minimal set of enzymes that has to be tailor-made. Partially defined complex mixtures that are currently commercially used are not adapted to efficiently degrade different materials, so novel enzyme mixtures have to be customized. Development of these cocktails requires better knowledge about the specific activities involved, in order to optimize hydrolysis. The role of filamentous fungus Myceliophthora thermophila and its complete enzymatic repertoire for the bioconversion of complex carbohydrates has been widely proven. In this study, four core cellulases (MtCBH7, MtCBH6, MtEG5, and MtEG7), in the presence of other four ""accessory"" enzymes (manse, lytic polyssacharide monooxygese MtGH61, xylase, MtFae1a) and beta-glucosidase MtBGL3, were tested as a nine-component cocktail against one model substrate (phosphoric acid swollen cellulose) and four hydrothermally pretreated tural substrates (wheat straw as an agricultural waste, birch, and spruce biomass, as forest residues). Synergistic interactions among different enzymes were determined using a suitable design of experiments methodology. The results suggest that for the hydrolysis of the pure substrate (PASC), high proportions of MtEG7 are needed for efficient yields. MtCBH7 and MtEG7 are enzymes of major importance during the hydrolysis of pretreated wheat straw, while MtCBH7 plays a crucial role in case of spruce. Cellobiohydrolases MtCBH6 and MtCBH7 act in combition and are key enzymes for the hydrolysis of the hardwood (birch). Optimum combitions were predicted from suitable statistical models which were able to further increase hydrolysis yields, suggesting that tailor-made enzyme mixtures targeted toward a particular residual biomass can help maximize hydrolysis yields. The present work demonstrates the change from ""one cocktail for all"" to ""tailor-made cocktails"" that are needed for the efficient saccharification of targeted feed stocks prior to the production of biobased products through the biorefinery concept."

26490891	Assessing the use of noimmobilized laccases to remove micropollutants from wastewater	Enzymes immobilization is a useful way to allow enzyme reuse and increase their stability. A high redox potential laccase from Trametes versicolor (TvL) and a low redox potential, but commercially available low-cost laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila (MtL), were successfully immobilized and co-immobilized onto fumed silica noparticles (fsNP). Enzyme loads of 1.78 +/- 0.07, 0.69 +/- 0.03, and 1.10 +/- 0.01 U/mg fsNP were attained for the optimal doses of TvL, MtL, and co-immobilized laccases, respectively. In general, the laccase-fsNP conjugates showed a higher resistance against an acidic pH value (i.e., pH 3), and a higher storage stability than free enzymes. In addition, immobilized enzymes exhibited a superior long-term stability than free laccases when incubated in a secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). For instance, the residual activity after 2 weeks for the co-immobilized laccases and the mixture of free laccases were 40.2 +/- 2.5% and 16.8 +/- 1.0%, respectively. The ability of the laccase-fsNP to remove a mixture of (14)C-bisphenol A (BPA) and (14)C-sodium diclofec (DCF) from spiked secondary effluents was assessed in batch experiments. The catalytic efficiency was highly dependent on both the microbial source and state of the biocatalyst. The high redox potential TvL in free form attained a four-fold higher percentage of BPA transformation than the free MtL. Compared to free laccases, immobilized enzymes led to much slower rates of BPA transformation. For instance, after 24 h, the percentages of BPA transformation by 1000 U/L of a mixture of free laccases or co-immobilized enzymes were 67.8 +/- 5.2 and 27.0 +/- 3.9%, respectively. Nevertheless, the use of 8000 U/L of co-immobilized laccase led to a nearly complete removal of BPA, despite the unfavorable conditions for laccase catalysis (pH ~ 8.4). DCF transformation was not observed for any of the enzymatic systems, showing that this compound is highly recalcitrant toward laccase oxidation under realistic conditions.

26907693	Functiol Evolution in Orthologous Cell-encoded R-dependent R Polymerases	Many eukaryotic organisms encode more than one R-dependent R polymerase (RdRP) that probably emerged as a result of gene duplication. Such RdRP paralogs often participate in distinct R silencing pathways and show characteristic repertoires of enzymatic activities in vitro However, to what extent members of individual paralogous groups can undergo functiol changes during speciation remains an open question. We show that orthologs of QDE-1, an RdRP component of the quelling pathway in Neurospora crassa, have rapidly diverged in evolution at the amino acid sequence level. Alyses of purified QDE-1 polymerases from N. crassa (QDE-1(Ncr)) and related fungi, Thielavia terrestris (QDE-1(Tte)) and Myceliophthora thermophila (QDE-1(Mth)), show that all three enzymes can synthesize R, but the precise modes of their action differ considerably. Unlike their QDE-1(Ncr) counterpart favoring processive R synthesis, QDE-1(Tte) and QDE-1(Mth) produce predomintly short R copies via primer-independent initiation. Surprisingly, a 3.19 A resolution crystal structure of QDE-1(Tte) reveals a quasisymmetric dimer similar to QDE-1(Ncr) Further electron microscopy alyses confirm that QDE-1(Tte) occurs as a dimer in solution and retains this status upon interaction with a template. We conclude that divergence of orthologous RdRPs can result in functiol innovation while retaining overall protein fold and quaterry structure.

27297903	Isolation of Homogeneous Polysaccharide Monooxygeses from Fungal Sources and Investigation of Their Synergism with Cellulases when Acting on Cellulose	Lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses (PMO) discovered several years ago are enzymes classified as oxidoreductases. In ture, they participate in microbial degradation of cellulose together with cellulases that belong to the hydrolytic type of enzymes (class of hydrolases). Three PMO from ascomycetes - Thielavia terrestris, Trichoderma reesei, and Myceliophthora thermophila - were isolated and purified to homogeneous state using various types of chromatography. The first two enzymes are recombint proteins heterologously expressed by the Penicillium verruculosum fungus, while the third is a tive PMO secreted by M. thermophila. When acting on microcrystalline cellulose, all these PMOs displayed synergism with the cellulase complex of the P. verruculosum fungus. Replacing 10% of cellulases (by protein concentration) with PMO in the presence of 6.25 mM gallic acid or 2.5 microM of cellobiose dehydrogese from M. thermophila, used as electron donors for PMO, resulted in the 17-31% increase in the yield of reducing sugars after 24-48 h of the enzymatic reaction.

26433602	Mixed Substrate Fermentation for Enhanced Phytase Production by Thermophilic Mould Sporotrichum thermophile and Its Application in Beneficiation of Poultry Feed	The optimum values of the critical variables determined by the central composite design of response surface methodology (RSM) for maximum phytase production (1881.26 U g(-1) dry mouldy residue (DMR)) by Sporotrichum thermophile are 2.5 % Tween 80, 1.0 % yeast extract and 48 h of incubation period. Phytase production in the mixed substrate (sugarcane bagasse and wheat bran) fermentation enhanced 11.6-fold over the initial production as a consequence of optimization. Phytase titres are sustaible in flasks, trays and column bioreactor (1796 to 2095 U g(-1) DMR), thus validating the model and the process for large-scale phytase production. When the yeast extract was replaced with corn steep liquor (2 % w/v), a sustained enzyme titre (1890 U g(-1) DMR) was attained, making the process cost-effective. Among all the detergents, Tween 80 supported a higher phytase production than others. The enzyme efficiently liberated nutritiol components from poultry feed (inorganic phosphate, soluble protein and reducing sugars) in a time-dependent manner.

A statistical optimization approach involving Plackett-Burman design and response surface methodology (RSM) resulted in the production of 72,410, 36,420, 32,420 and 5180 U/l of xylase, CMCase, FPase and beta-glucosidase, respectively. Optimization resulted in more than fourfold improvements in production of xylanolytic and cellulolytic enzymes. Scale up of enzymes production in shake flasks of varied volumes was sustaible, suggesting a good scope for large scale enzyme production. Addition of microparticles engineered fungal morphology and enhanced enzymes production. Xylase of S. thermophile is a neutral xylase displaying its optimal activity at 60  degrees C while all the cellulases are optimally active at pH 5.0 and 60  degrees C. The efficacy of enzyme cocktail in waste tea cup paper and rice straw hydrolysis showed that maximum sugar yield of 578.12 and 421.79 mg/g substrate for waste tea cup and rice straw, respectively, were achieved after 24 h. Therefore, concomitant production of cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes will be beneficial for the saccharification of lignocellulosics in generating both monomeric and oligomeric sugars for biofuels and other biotechnological applications.

26758064	Recombint HAP Phytase of the Thermophilic Mold Sporotrichum thermophile: Expression of the Codon-Optimized Phytase Gene in Pichia pastoris and Applications	The codon-optimized phytase gene of the thermophilic mold Sporotrichum thermophile (St-Phy) was expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombint P. pastoris harboring the phytase gene (rSt-Phy) yielded a high titer of extracellular phytase (480 +/- 23 U/mL) on induction with methanol. The recombint phytase production was ~40-fold higher than that of the tive fungal strain. The purified recombint phytase (rSt-Phy) has the molecular mass of 70 kDa on SDS-PAGE, with K m and V max (calcium phytate), k cat and k cat/K m values of 0.147 mM and 183 nmol/mg s, 1.3 x 10(3)/s and 8.84 x 10(6)/M s, respectively. Mg(2+) and Ba(2+) display a slight stimulatory effect, while other cations tested exert inhibitory action on phytase. The enzyme is inhibited by chaotropic agents (guanidinium hydrochloride, potassium iodide, and urea), Woodward's reagent K and 2,3-butedione, but resistant to both pepsin and trypsin. The rSt-Phy is useful in the dephytinization of broiler feeds efficiently in simulated gut conditions of chick leading to the liberation of soluble inorganic phosphate with concomitant mitigation in antinutrient effects of phytates.

25025273	Myceliophthora thermophila syn. Sporotrichum thermophile: a thermophilic mould of biotechnological potential	Myceliophthora thermophila syn. Sporotrichum thermophile is a ubiquitous thermophilic mould with a strong ability to degrade organic matter during optimal growth at 45  degrees C. Both genome alysis and experimental data have suggested that the mould is capable of hydrolyzing all major polysaccharides found in biomass. The mould is able to secrete a large number of hydrolytic enzymes (cellulases, laccases, xylases, pectises, lipases, phytases and some other miscellaneous enzymes) employed in various biotechnological applications. Characterization of the biomass-hydrolyzing activity of wild and recombint enzymes suggests that this mould is highly efficient in biomass decomposition at both moderate and high temperatures. The tive enzymes produced by the mould are more efficient in activity than their mesophilic counterparts beside their low enzyme titers. The mould is able to synthesize various biomolecules, which are used in multifarious applications. Genome sequence data of M. thermophila also supported the physiological data. This review describes the biotechnological potential of thermophilic mould, M. thermophila supported by genomic and experimental evidences.

27193267	A thermostable GH26 endo-beta-manse from Myceliophthora thermophila capable of enhancing lignocellulose degradation	The endomanse gene em26a from the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila, belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family 26, was functiolly expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The putative endomanse, dubbed MtMan26A, was purified to homogeneity (60 kDa) and subsequently characterized. The optimum pH and temperature for the enzymatic activity of MtMan26A were 6.0 and 60  degrees C, respectively. MtMan26A showed high specific activity against konjac glucomann and carob galactomann, while it also exhibited high thermal stability with a half-life of 14.4 h at 60  degrees C. Thermostability is of great importance, especially in industrial processes where harsh conditions are employed. With the aim of better understanding its structure-function relationships, a homology model of MtMan26A was constructed, based on the crystallographic structure of a close homologue. Filly, the addition of MtMan26A as a supplement to the commercial enzyme mixture Celluclast(R) 1.5 L and Novozyme(R) 188 resulted in enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated beechwood sawdust, improving the release of total reducing sugars and glucose by 13 and 12 %, respectively.

27128897	Bioconversion of Biomass-Derived Phenols Catalyzed by Myceliophthora thermophila Laccase	Biomass-derived phenols have recently arisen as an attractive altertive for building blocks to be used in synthetic applications, due to their widespread availability as an abundant renewable resource. In the present paper, commercial laccase from the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila was used to bioconvert phenol monomers, mely catechol, pyrogallol and gallic acid in water. The resulting products from catechol and gallic acid were polymers that were partially characterized in respect to their optical and thermal properties, and their average molecular weight was estimated via solution viscosity measurements and GPC. FT-IR and (1)H-NMR data suggest that phenol monomers are connected with ether or C-C bonds depending on the starting monomer, while the achieved molecular weight of polycatechol is found higher than the corresponding poly(gallic acid). On the other hand, under the same condition, pyrogallol was dimerized in a pure red crystalline compound and its structure was confirmed by (1)H-NMR as purpurogallin. The herein studied green synthesis of enzymatically synthesized phenol polymers or biological active compounds could be exploited as an altertive synthetic route targeting a variety of applications.	catechol, enzymatic oligomerization, gallic acid, laccase, pyrogallol	Molecules	Biotechnology Laboratory, School of Chemical Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, 5 Iroon Polytechniou Str., Zografou Campus, Athens 15780, Greece. natassaz@gmail.com.

26722808	Increasing the lignin yield of the Alkaline Polyol Pulping process by treating black liquor with laccases of Myceliophthora thermophila	The Alkaline Polyol Pulping process separates cellulose from lignocellulosic biomass by dissolving lignin to a great extent. Due to the pulping conditions the dissolved lignin depolymerises and only 75% can be precipitated. To increase this amount, a 24 h reaction of laccases of Myceliophthora thermophila with lignin dissolved in black liquor of the AlkaPolP process was investigated. The influence of pH, temperature, enzyme concentration and partial oxygen pressure was examined in a batch stirred tank reactor using a Box-Behnken factorial design. Due to the enzymatic reaction the lignin polymerises which results in an enhanced lignin precipitation. The addition of a mediator improves the polymerisation but decreases the amount of precipitable lignin. The influence of the parameters on precipitation yield and molecular mass can sufficiently be described with a second-order model and optimum conditions can be assessed. FT-IR spectra of the obtained lignins revealed that its typical phenolic structure is preserved.

27286691	Efficacy and safety of itracozole use in infants	"BACKGROUND: Itracozole has been used to treat fungal infections, in particular invasive fungal infections in infants or neotes in many countries. DATA SOURCES: Literature search was conducted through Ovid EMBASE, PubMed, ISI Web of Science, CNKI and Google scholarship using the following key words: ""pediatric"" or ""infant"" or ""neote"" and ""fungal infection"" in combition with ""itracozole"". Based on the literature and our clinical experience, we outline the administration of itracozole in infants in order to develop evidence-based pharmacotherapy. RESULTS: Of 45 articles on the use of itracozole in infancy, 13 are related to superficial fungal infections including tinea capitis, sporotrichosis, mucosal fungal infections and opportunistic infections. The other 32 articles are related to systemic fungal infections including candidiasis, aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, zygomycosis, trichosporonosis and opportunistic infections as caused by Myceliophthora thermophila. CONCLUSION: Itracozole is safe and effective at a dose of 5 mg/kg per day in a short duration of therapy for superficial fungal infections and 10 mg/kg per day for systemic fungal infections in infants. With a good compliance, it is cost-effective in treating infantile fungal infections. The profiles of adverse events induced by itracozole in infants are similar to those in adults and children."	infant, itracozole, prophylaxis, superficial fungal infections, systemic fungal infections	World journal of pediatrics : WJP	Department of Dermatovenereology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.

27919072	Structure and regulation of the chromatin remodeller ISWI	ISWI is a member of the SWI2/SNF2 family of chromatin remodellers, which also includes Snf2, Chd1, and Ino80. ISWI is the catalytic subunit of several chromatin remodelling complexes, which mobilize nucleosomes along genomic D, promoting replication progression, transcription repression, heterochromatin formation, and many other nuclear processes. The ATPase motor of ISWI is an autonomous remodelling machine, whereas its carboxy (C)-termil HAND-SAND-SLIDE (HSS) domain functions in binding extranucleosomal linker D. The activity of the catalytic core of ISWI is inhibited by the regulatory AutoN and NegC domains, which are in turn antagonized by the H4 tail and extranucleosomal D, respectively, to ensure the appropriate chromatin landscape in cells. How AutoN and NegC inhibit ISWI and regulate its nucleosome-centring activity remains elusive. Here we report the crystal structures of ISWI from the thermophilic yeast Myceliophthora thermophila and its complex with a histone H4 peptide. Our data show the amino (N)-termil AutoN domain contains two inhibitory elements, which collectively bind the second RecA-like domain (core2), holding the enzyme in an ictive conformation. The H4 peptide binds to the core2 domain coincident with one of the AutoN-binding sites, explaining the ISWI activation by H4. The H4-binding surface is conserved in Snf2 and functions beyond AutoN regulation. The C-termil NegC domain is involved in binding to the core2 domain and functions as an allosteric element for ISWI to respond to the extranucleosomal D length.

27399259	Structure of chromatin remodeler Swi2/Snf2 in the resting state	SWI2/SNF2 family proteins regulate a myriad of nucleic acid transactions by sliding, removing and reconstructing nucleosomes in eukaryotic cells. They contain two RecA-like core domains, which couple ATP hydrolysis and D translocation to chromatin remodeling. Here we report the crystal structure of Snf2 from the yeast Myceliophthora thermophila. The data show the two RecA-like core domains of Snf2 stacking together and twisting their ATP-binding motifs away from each other, thus explaining the ictivity of the protein in the ground state. We identified several D-binding elements, which are fully exposed to solvent, thus suggesting that the protein is poised for its incoming substrate. The catalytic core of Snf2 showed a high chromatin-remodeling activity, which was suppressed by the N-termil HSA domain. Our findings reveal that the catalytic core of Snf2 is a competent remodeling machine, which rests in an ictive conformation and requires a large conformatiol change upon activation.

26773948	Saccharification of ozoted sugarcane bagasse using enzymes from Myceliophthora thermophila JCP 1-4 for sugars release and ethanol production	The saccharification of ozoted sugarcane bagasse (SCB) by enzymes from Myceliophthora thermophila JCP 1-4 was studied. Fungal enzymes provided slightly higher sugar release than commercial enzymes, working at 50 degrees C. Sugar release increased with temperature increase. Kinetic studies showed remarkable glucose release (4.99 g/L, 3%w/w dry matter) at 60 degrees C, 8 h of hydrolysis, using an enzyme load of 10 FPU (filter paper unit). FPase and beta-glucosidase activities increased during saccharification (284% and 270%, respectively). No further significant improvement on glucose release was observed increasing the enzyme load above 7.5 FPU per g of cellulose. Higher dry matter contents increased sugars release, but not yields. The fermentation of hydrolysates by Saccharomyces cerevisiae provided glucose-to-ethanol conversions around to 63%.

27807811	Myceliophthora thermophila M77 utilizes hydrolytic and oxidative mechanisms to deconstruct biomass	Biomass is abundant, renewable and useful for biofuel production as well as chemical priming for plastics and composites. Deconstruction of biomass by enzymes is perceived as recalcitrant while an inclusive breakdown mechanism remains to be discovered. Fungi such as Myceliophthora thermophila M77 appear to decompose tural biomass sources quite well. This work reports on this fungus fermentation property while producing cellulolytic enzymes using tural biomass substrates. Little hydrolytic activity was detected, insufficient to explain the large amount of biomass depleted in the process. Furthermore, this work makes a comprehensive account of extracellular proteins and describes how secretomes redirect their qualitative protein content based on the ture and chemistry of the nutritiol source. Fungus grown on purified cellulose or on tural biomass produced secretomes constituted by: cellobiohydrolases, cellobiose dehydrogese, beta-1,3 glucase, beta-glucosidases, aldose epimerase, glyoxal oxidase, GH74 xyloglucase, galactosidase, aldolactose and polysaccharide monooxygeses. Fungus grown on a mixture of purified hemicellulose fractions (xylans, arabins and arabinoxylans) produced many enzymes, some of which are listed here: xylosidase, mixed beta-1,3(4) glucase, beta-1,3 glucases, beta-glucosidases, beta-mannosidase, beta-glucosidases, galactosidase, chitises, polysaccharide lyase, endo beta-1,6 galactase and aldose epimerase. Secretomes produced on tural biomass displayed a comprehensive set of enzymes involved in hydrolysis and oxidation of cellulose, hemicellulose-pectin and lignin. The participation of oxidation reactions coupled to lignin decomposition in the breakdown of tural biomass may explain the discrepancy observed for cellulose decomposition in relation to tural biomass fermentation experiments.

In this work, the laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila was successfully immobilized onto Accurel MP1000 beads (67% of protein bound to the polymeric carrier) and the biocatalyzed oxidation of Kraft lignin (KL) and lignosulfote (LS) were carried out. Fluorescence intensity determition, phenol content alysis and size exclusion chromatography were performed in order to elucidate the extent of the polymerization reaction. The collected results show an 8.5-fold decrease of the LS samples' fluorescence intensity after laccase-mediated oxidation and a 12-fold increase of the weight average molecular weight was obtained.	biocatalyzed polymerization, enzyme immobilization, green processing, laccase, lignin	Polymers	Institute of Environmental Biotechnology, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Konrad Lorenz Str. 20, 3430 Tulln, Austria. daniela.huber@boku.ac.at.

27629413	Discovery of a Xylooligosaccharide Oxidase from Myceliophthora thermophila C1	By inspection of the predicted proteome of the fungus Myceliophthora thermophila C1 for vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (VAO)-type flavoprotein oxidases, a putative oligosaccharide oxidase was identified. By homologous expression and subsequent purification, the respective protein could be obtained. The protein was found to contain a bicovalently bound FAD cofactor. By screening a large number of carbohydrates, several mono- and oligosaccharides could be identified as substrates. The enzyme exhibits a strong substrate preference toward xylooligosaccharides; hence it is med xylooligosaccharide oxidase (XylO). Chemical alyses of the product formed upon oxidation of xylobiose revealed that the oxidation occurs at C1, yielding xylobiote as product. By elucidation of several XylO crystal structures (in complex with a substrate mimic, xylose, and xylobiose), the residues that tune the unique substrate specificity and regioselectivity could be identified. The discovery of this novel oligosaccharide oxidase reveals that the VAO-type flavoprotein family harbors oxidases tuned for specific oligosaccharides. The unique substrate profile of XylO hints at a role in the degradation of xylan-derived oligosaccharides by the fungus M. thermophila C1.

30383933	CHARACTERISTICS OF FUNGAL STRAINS PRODUCING THERMOSTABLE XYLOGLUCASES FROM THE RUSSIAN TIOL COLLECTION OF INDUSTRIAL MICROORGANISMS	Fungal strains degrading plant biomass available from the Russian tiol Collection of Industrial Microorganisms (VKPM) have been screened for the xyloglucase activity. Under conditions of submerged cultivation, the thermophilic strains Sporotrichum thermophile VKPM F-972, Myceliophthora thermophila VKPM F-244, and Sporotrichum pruinosum VKPM F-235 produced extracellular xyloglucases with optimal activity at 60 degrees C, pH 5.0. 88-100% of the initial enzyme activity was retained after l-h incubation at 50 degrees C; 79-84% of the activity was retained after l-h incubation at 60 degrees C. S. thermophile VKPM F-972, M. thermophila VKPM F-244, and S. pruinosum VKPM F-235 strains may be used as the gene sources for construction of highly active producers of the thermostable xyloglucases.

25822992	Atomic structure of the Y complex of the nuclear pore	The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is the principal gateway for transport into and out of the nucleus. Selectivity is achieved through the hydrogel-like core of the NPC. The structural integrity of the NPC depends on ~15 architectural proteins, which are organized in distinct subcomplexes to form the >40-MDa ring-like structure. Here we present the 4.1-A crystal structure of a heterotetrameric core element ('hub') of the Y complex, the essential NPC building block, from Myceliophthora thermophila. Using the hub structure together with known Y-complex fragments, we built the entire ~0.5-MDa Y complex. Our data reveal that the conserved core of the Y complex has six rather than seven members. Evolutiorily distant Y-complex assemblies share a conserved core that is very similar in shape and dimension, thus suggesting that there are closely related architectural codes for constructing the NPC in all eukaryotes.

26185526	Discovery of the combined oxidative cleavage of plant xylan and cellulose by a new fungal polysaccharide monooxygese	BACKGROUND: Many agricultural and industrial food by-products are rich in cellulose and xylan. Their enzymatic degradation into monosaccharides is seen as a basis for the production of biofuels and bio-based chemicals. Lytic polysaccharide monooxygeses (LPMOs) constitute a group of recently discovered enzymes, classified as the auxiliary activity subgroups AA9, AA10, AA11 and AA13 in the CAZy database. LPMOs cleave cellulose, chitin, starch and beta-(1 --> 4)-linked substituted and non-substituted glucosyl units of hemicellulose under formation of oxidized gluco-oligosaccharides. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate a new LPMO, obtained from Myceliophthora thermophila C1 (MtLPMO9A). This enzyme cleaves beta-(1 --> 4)-xylosyl bonds in xylan under formation of oxidized xylo-oligosaccharides, while it simultaneously cleaves beta-(1 --> 4)-glucosyl bonds in cellulose under formation of oxidized gluco-oligosaccharides. In particular, MtLPMO9A benefits from the strong interaction between low substituted linear xylan and cellulose. MtLPMO9A shows a strong synergistic effect with endoglucase I (EGI) with a 16-fold higher release of detected oligosaccharides, compared to the oligosaccharides release of MtLPMO9A and EGI alone. CONCLUSION: Now, for the first time, we demonstrate the activity of a lytic polysaccharide monooxygese (MtLPMO9A) that shows oxidative cleavage of xylan in addition to cellulose. The ability of MtLPMO9A to cleave these rigid regions provides a new paradigm in the understanding of the degradation of xylan-coated cellulose. In addition, MtLPMO9A acts in strong synergism with endoglucase I. The mode of action of MtLPMO9A is considered to be important for loosening the rigid xylan-cellulose polysaccharide matrix in plant biomass, ebling increased accessibility to the matrix for hydrolytic enzymes. This discovery provides new insights into how to boost plant biomass degradation by enzyme cocktails for biorefinery applications.

25541341	Glucoamylases from Penicillium verruculosum and Myceliophthora thermophila: alysis of differences in activity against polymeric substrates based on 3D model structures of the intact enzymes	Two glucoamylases, a recombint enzyme from Penicillium verruculosum (PvGla) heterologously expressed in Penicillium canescens RN3-11-7 (niaD-) strain and a tive glucoamylase from Myceliophthora thermophila (MtGla), were purified and their properties were studied. MtGla displayed 2-5-fold higher specific activities against soluble starch, amylose and amylopectin than PvGla. MtGla also provided higher glucose yields in extended hydrolysis of the polymeric substrates. Alysis of 3D model structures of the intact PvGla and MtGla, which were built using the 2vn7.pdb crystal structure of the intact Trichoderma reesei glucoamylase (TrGla) as a template, showed that the reason for lower hydrolytic performance of PvGla in comparison to MtGla may be less strong interactions between the enzyme domains as well as a longer (by 17 residues) linker in the first enzyme.

New enzyme preparations with highly stable activity against beta-glucan and lamirin were obtained and investigated, homogeneous enzymes EG2 (EC 3.2.1.4) and LAM (EC 3.2.1.6) being purified and characterized. For beta-glucan, the EG2 Km value was found to be 10 times higher than that for LAM; however, EG2 demonstrated greater processivity due to its higher kcat. The pH and temperature optima of EG2 and LAM activity against barley beta-glucan overlapped and were 4.3-4.9 and 61-67 degrees C, respectively, and EG2 appeared to be more stable than LAM. Oligosaccharides with degree of polymerization 2-10 were formed by hydrolysis of beta-glucan and lamirin by the studied enzymes. The recombint enzyme preparations were faster and more effective in decreasing the reduced viscosity of wholegrain barley extract than some commercial enzyme preparations. Thus, the new enzyme preparations seem to be rather perspective as feed additives for degradation of non-starch polysaccharides in grain animal feed.		Biochemistry.

26433599	Characteristics of Recombint Phytase (rSt-Phy) of the Thermophilic mold Sporotrichum thermophile and its applicability in dephytinizing foods	Sporotrichum thermophile produces very low titres of phytase (St-Phy) extracellularly, which is acidstable, thermostable, and protease insensitive with broad substrate specificity, and therefore, the gene encoding phytase (St-Phy) has been cloned and expressed in E. coli. The purified recombint phytase (rSt-Phy) has the molecular mass of 55 kDa with Km and Vmax (calcium phytate), kcat and kcat/Km of 0.143 mM, 185.05 nmoles mg(-1)  s(-1), 5.1 x 10(3) s(-1), and 3.5 x 10(7) M(-1) s(-1), respectively. Mg(2+) and Ba(2+) display slight stimulatory effect on the enzyme, while it is inhibited by other ions to a varied extent. The enzyme is also inhibited by chaotropic agents (guanidinium hydrochloride, potassium iodide, and urea), Woodward's reagent K, and 2,3-butanedione but resistant to both pepsin and trypsin. The rSt-Phy is useful in dephytinization of tandoori and an (unleavened flat Indian breads), and bread, liberating soluble inorganic phosphate that mitigates anti-nutrient effects of phytic acid.

26047916	Characterization and application of a novel class II thermophilic peroxidase from Myceliophthora thermophila in biosynthesis of polycatechol	A peroxidase from the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila that belongs to ascomycete Class II based on PeroxiBase classification was functiolly expressed in methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The putative peroxidase from the genomic D was successfully cloned in P. pastoris X-33 under the transcriptiol control of the alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter. The heterologous production was greatly enhanced by the addition of hemin with a titer of 0.41 U mL(-1) peroxidase activity at the second day of incubation. The recombint enzyme was purified to homogeneity (50 kDa) and characterized using a series of phenolic substrates that indicated similar characteristics with those of generic peroxidases. In addition, the enzyme was found thermostable, retaining its activity for temperatures up to 60  degrees C after eight hours incubation. Moreover, the enzyme displayed remarkable H2O2 stability, retaining more than 80% of its initial activity after 24h incubation in 5000-fold molar excess of H2O2. The ability of the peroxidase to polymerize catechol at high superoxide concentrations, together with its high thermostability and substrate specificity, indicate a potential commercial significance of the enzyme.

25941560	Effect of mutations on the thermostability of Aspergillus aculeatus beta-1,4-galactase	New variants of beta-1,4-galactase from the mesophilic organism Aspergillus aculeatus were designed using the structure of beta-1,4-galactase from the thermophile organism Myceliophthora thermophila as a template. Some of the variants were generated using PROPKA 3.0, a validated pKa prediction tool, to test its usefulness as an enzyme design tool. The PROPKA designed variants were D182N and S185D/Q188T, G104D/A156R. Variants Y295F and G306A were designed by a consensus approach, as a complementary and validated design method. D58N was a stabilizing mutation predicted by both methods. The predictions were experimentally validated by measurements of the melting temperature (Tm ) by differential scanning calorimetry. We found that the Tm is elevated by 1.1  degrees C for G306A, slightly increased (in the range of 0.34 to 0.65  degrees C) for D182N, D58N, Y295F and unchanged or decreased for S185D/Q188T and G104D/A156R. The Tm changes were in the range predicted by PROPKA. Given the experimental errors, only the D58N and G306A show significant increase in thermodymic stability. Given the practical importance of kinetic stability, the kinetics of the irreversible enzyme ictivation process were also investigated for the wild-type and three variants and found to be biphasic. The half-lives of thermal ictivation were approximately doubled in G306A, unchanged for D182N and, disappointingly, a lot lower for D58N. In conclusion, this study tests a new method for estimating Tm changes for mutants, adds to the available data on the effect of substitutions on protein thermostability and identifies an interesting thermostabilizing mutation, which may be beneficial also in other galactases.

26173497	Enhancing xylase production in the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila by homologous overexpression of Mtxyr1	The xylase regulator 1 protein in Myceliophthora thermophila ATCC42464 (MtXyr1) is 60 % homologous with that of Trichoderma reesei. However, MtXyr1's regulatory role on cellulolytic and xylanolytic genes in M. thermophila is unknown. Herein, MtXyr1 was overexpressed under the control of the MtPpdc (pyruvate decarboxylase) promoter. Compared with the wild type, the extracellular xylase activities of the transformant cultured in non-inducing and inducing media for 120 h were 25.19- and 9.04-fold higher, respectively. The Mtxyr1 mR level was 300-fold higher than in the wild type in corncob-containing medium. However, the filter paper activity and endoglucase activities were unchanged in corncob-containing medium and glucose-containing medium. The different zymograms between the transformant and the wild type were alyzed and identified by mass spectrometry as three xylases of the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 11. Thus, overexpression of xyr1 resulted in enhanced xylase activity in M. thermophila. Xylase production could be improved by overexpressing Mtxyr1 in M. thermophila.

25841015	Functiol Alysis of Two l-Arabinose Transporters from Filamentous Fungi Reveals Promising Characteristics for Improved Pentose Utilization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Limited uptake is one of the bottlenecks for l-arabinose fermentation from lignocellulosic hydrolysates in engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This study characterized two novel l-arabinose transporters, LAT-1 from Neurospora crassa and MtLAT-1 from Myceliophthora thermophila. Although the two proteins share high identity (about 83%), they display different substrate specificities. Sugar transport assays using the S. cerevisiae strain EBY.VW4000 indicated that LAT-1 accepts a broad substrate spectrum. In contrast, MtLAT-1 appeared much more specific for l-arabinose. Determition of the kinetic properties of both transporters revealed that the Km values of LAT-1 and MtLAT-1 for l-arabinose were 58.12 +/- 4.06 mM and 29.39 +/- 3.60 mM, respectively, with corresponding Vmax values of 116.7 +/- 3.0 mmol/h/g dry cell weight (DCW) and 10.29 +/- 0.35 mmol/h/g DCW, respectively. In addition, both transporters were found to use a proton-coupled symport mechanism and showed only partial inhibition by d-glucose during l-arabinose uptake. Moreover, LAT-1 and MtLAT-1 were expressed in the S. cerevisiae strain BSW2AP containing an l-arabinose metabolic pathway. Both recombint strains exhibited much faster l-arabinose utilization, greater biomass accumulation, and higher ethanol production than the control strain. In conclusion, because of higher maximum velocities and reduced inhibition by d-glucose, the genes for the two characterized transporters are promising targets for improved l-arabinose utilization and fermentation in S. cerevisiae.

26013561	Development of genetic tools for Myceliophthora thermophila	BACKGROUND: The thermophilic filamentous fungus Myceliophthora thermophila has many suitable characteristics for industrial biotechnology and could be a promising new chassis system for synthetic biology, particularly the ATCC 42464 strain, whose genome was sequenced in 2011. However, metabolic engineering of this strain using genetic approaches has not been reported owing to a lack of genetic tools for this organism. RESULTS: In the present study, we developed a high efficiency Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation system for M. thermophila, including an approach for targeted gene deletion using green fluorescence protein (GFP) as a marker for selection. Up to 145 transformants per 10(5) conidia were obtained in one transformation plate. Moreover, a ku70 deletion mutant was constructed in the ATCC 42464 background using the tools developed in present study and subsequently characterized. The ku70 deletion construct was designed using resistance to phosphinothricin as the selection marker. Additiolly, a GFP-encoding cassette was incorporated that allowed for the selection of site-specific (no fluorescence) or ectopic (fluorescence) integration of the ku70 construct. Transformants with ectopically integrated ku70 deletion constructs were therefore identified using the fluorescent sigl of GFP. PCR and Southern blotting alyses of non-fluorescent putative ku70 deletion transformants revealed all 11 tested transformants to be correct deletions. The deletion frequency in a pool of 116 transformants alyzed was 58 %. Moreover, the homologous rate improved about 3 folds under ku70 mutant using the pyrG as a test gene to disrupt in M. thermophila. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully developed an efficient transformation and target gene disruption approach for M. thermophila ATCC 42464 mediated by A. tumefaciens. The tools and the ku70 deletion strain developed here should advance the development of M. thermophila as an industrial host through metabolic engineering and accelerate the elucidation of the mechanism of rapid cellulose degradation in this thermophilic fungus.

26234435	Heterologous Expression and Characterization of a GH3 beta-Glucosidase from Thermophilic Fungi Myceliophthora thermophila in Pichia pastoris	A novel beta-glucosidase of glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 3 from Myceliophthora thermophila (mtbgl3b) was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris. The full-length gene consists of 2613 bp nucleotides encoding a protein of 870 amino acids. MtBgl3b showed maximum activity at pH 5.0 and remained more than 70 % relative activity at 3.5-6.0. The enzyme displayed the highest activity at 60  degrees C and kept about 90 % relative activity for 50-65  degrees C; besides, the enzyme showed psychrophilic trait and remains 51 % relative activity at 40  degrees C. MtBgl3b exhibited good stability over a wide pH range of 3.0-10.0 and was thermostable at 60 and 65  degrees C. The enzyme displayed highest activity towards p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG), followed by p-nitrophenyl-D-cellobioside (pNPC), cellotetraose, cellotriose, cellobiose, and gentiobiose. When using 10 % cellobiose (w/v) as the substrate, the enzyme showed transglycosylation activity to produce the cellotriose. The kinetic parametric of K m and V max were 2.78 mM and 927.9 muM mg(-1) min(-1), respectively. Filly, the reaction mode of the enzyme and the substrates were alyzed by molecular docking approach.

25644433	Thermophilic fungi as new sources for production of cellulases and xylases with potential use in sugarcane bagasse saccharification	AIMS: To obtain new cellulases and xylases from thermophilic fungi; evaluate their potential for sugarcane bagasse saccharification. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-two heat-tolerant fungi were isolated from the environment, identified (morphological/molecular tools) and the production of the enzymes was evaluated by solid state fermentation using lignocellulosic materials as substrates. Myceliophthora thermophila JCP 1-4 was the best producer of endoglucase (357.51 U g(-1) ), beta-glucosidase (45.42 U g(-1) ), xylase (931.11 U g(-1) ) and avicelase (3.58 U g(-1) ). These enzymes were most active at 55-70 degrees C and stable at 30-60 degrees C. Using crude enzymatic extract from M. thermophila JCP 1-4 to saccharify sugarcane bagasse pretreated with microwaves and glycerol, glucose and xylose yields obtained were 15.6 and 35.13% (2.2 and 1.95 g l(-1) ), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: All isolated fungi have potential to produce the enzymes; M. thermophila JCP 1-4 enzymatic extract have potential to be better explored in saccharification experiments. Pretreatment improved enzymatic saccharification, as sugar yields were much higher than those obtained from in tura bagasse. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Myceliophthora thermophila JCP 1-4 produces avicelase (not commonly found among fungi; important to hydrolyse crystalline cellulose) and a beta-glucosidase resistant to glucose inhibition, interesting characteristics for saccharification experiments.	enzymatic saccharification, glycerol, heat-tolerant fungi, microwaves, pretreatment	Journal of applied microbiology	Laboratory of Biochemistry and Applied Microbiology, Sao Paulo State University - UNESP/IBILCE, Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo State, Brazil.

26279477	Determition of Specificity and Biochemical Characteristics of Neutral Protease Isolated from Myceliophthora thermophila	Proteases hydrolyze polypeptides to release peptides and/or amino acids. This subclass of enzymes is among those with the most sales worldwide, particularly those produced by microorganisms. Proteases may be applied in the several industries, including the food industry, leather, detergents, and bioremediation. Myceliophthora thermophila protease was produced by a submerged bioprocess and then purified 185-fold by anion exchange and hydrophobic chromatography with a 37% yield. The molecular mass was estimated at 36.2 kDa, and mass spectrometry identified two sequences: GVVANMSLGGSYSASINAAALVR and STGAITGVPSGTTNR. The isolated protein was characterized biochemically, showed an optimum pH of 6.5 and optimum temperature of 45  degrees C, and stability at wide range of pH and temperatures and in the presence of reducing agents and some surfactants. Kinetic assays for this enzyme showed a greater catalytic efficiency when the substrate had alanine at position P'2. The protease presented characteristics that may be of interest to many industrial areas.

25824435	Enhancing Cellulase Production in Thermophilic Fungus Myceliophthora thermophila ATCC42464 by R Interference of cre1 Gene Expression	The role of CRE1 in a thermophilic fungus, Myceliophthora thermophila ATCC42464, was studied using R interference. In the cre1-silenced strain C88, the filter paper hydrolyzing activity and beta-1,4-endoglucase activity were 3.76-, and 1.31-fold higher, respectively, than those in the parental strain when the strains were cultured in inducing medium for 6 days. The activities of beta-1,4-exoglucase and cellobiase were 2.64-, and 5.59-fold higher, respectively, than those in the parental strain when the strains were cultured for 5 days. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that the gene expression of egl3, cbh1, and cbh2 was significantly increased in transformant C88 compared with the wild-type strain. Therefore, our findings suggest the feasibility of improving cellulase production by modifying the regulator expression, and an attractive approach to increasing the total cellulase productivity in thermophilic fungi.

25724976	Enhanced biological straw saccharification through coculturing of lignocellulose-degrading microorganisms	Lignocellulosic waste (LCW) is an abundant, low-cost, and inedible substrate for the induction of lignocellulolytic enzymes for cellulosic bioethanol production using an efficient, environmentally friendly, and economical biological approach. In this study, 30 different lignocellulose-degrading bacterial and 18 fungal isolates were quantitatively screened individually for the saccharification of four different ball-milled straw substrates: wheat, rice, sugarcane, and pea straw. Rice and sugarcane straws which had similar Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy profiles were more degradable, and resulted in more hydrolytic enzyme production than wheat and pea straws. Crude enzyme produced on tive straws performed better than those on artificial substrates (such as cellulose and xylan). Four fungal and five bacterial isolates were selected (based on their high strawase activities) for constructing dual and triple microbial combitions to investigate microbial synergistic effects on saccharification. Combitions such as FUNG16-FUNG17 (Neosartorya fischeri-Myceliophthora thermophila) and RMIT10-RMIT11 (Aeromos hydrophila-Pseudomos poae) enhanced saccharification (3- and 6.6-folds, respectively) compared with their monocultures indicating the beneficial effects of synergism between those isolates. Dual isolate combitions were more efficient at straw saccharification than triple combitions in both bacterial and fungal assays. Overall, co-culturing can result in significant increases in saccharification which may offer significant commercial potential for the use of microbial consortia.

25295862	Enhancement of synthetic Trichoderma-based enzyme mixtures for biomass conversion with an altertive family 5 glycosyl hydrolase from Sporotrichum thermophile	Enzymatic conversion of lignocellulosic materials to fermentable sugars is a limiting step in the production of biofuels from biomass. We show here that combining enzymes from different microbial sources is one way to identify superior enzymes. Extracts of the thermophilic fungus Sporotrichum thermophile (synonym Myceliophthora thermophila) gave synergistic release of glucose (Glc) and xylose (Xyl) from pretreated corn stover when combined with an 8-component synthetic cocktail of enzymes from Trichoderma reesei. The S. thermophile extracts were fractioted and an enhancing factor identified as endo-beta1,4-glucase (StCel5A or EG2) of subfamily 5 of Glycosyl Hydrolase family 5 (GH5_5). In multi-component optimization experiments using a standard set of enzymes and either StCel5A or the ortholog from T. reesei (TrCel5A), reactions containing StCel5A yielded more Glc and Xyl. In a five-component optimization experiment (i.e., varying four core enzymes and the source of Cel5A), the optimal proportions for TrCel5A vs. StCel5A were similar for Glc yields, but markedly different for Xyl yields. Both enzymes were active on lichen, glucomann, and oat beta-glucan; however, StCel5A but not TrCel5A was also active on beta1,4-mann, two types of galactomann, and beta1,4-xylan. Phylogenetically, fungal enzymes in GH5_5 sorted into two clades, with StCel5A and TrCel5A belonging to different clades. Structural differences with the potential to account for the differences in performance were deduced based on the known structure of TrCel5A and a homology-based model of StCel5A, including a loop near the active site of TrCel5A and the presence of four additiol Trp residues in the active cleft of StCel5A. The results indicate that superior biomass-degrading enzymes can be identified by exploring taxonomic diversity combined with assays in the context of realistic enzyme combitions and realistic substrates. Substrate range may be a key factor contributing to superior performance within GH5_5.

25037346	Characterization of an acetyl esterase from Myceliophthora thermophila C1 able to deacetylate xanthan	Screening of eight carbohydrate acetyl esterases for their activity towards xanthan resulted in the recognition of one active esterase. AXE3, a CAZy family CE1 acetyl xylan esterase origiting from Myceliophthora thermophila C1, removed 31% of all acetyl groups present in xanthan after a 48 h incubation. AXE3 activity towards xanthan was only observed when xanthan molecules were in the disordered conformation. Optimal performance towards xanthan was observed at 53  degrees C in the complete absence of salt, a condition favouring the disordered conformation. AXE3-deacetylated xanthan was hydrolyzed using cellulases and alyzed for its repeating units using UPLC-HILIC-ELSD/ESI-MS. This showed that AXE3 specifically removes the acetyl groups positioned on the inner mannose and that acetyl groups positioned on the outer mannose are not removed at all. After a prolonged incubation at optimal conditions, 57% of all acetyl groups, representing 70% of all acetyl groups on the inner mannose units, were hydrolyzed.

24995002	Genomic insights into the fungal lignocellulolytic system of Myceliophthora thermophila	The microbial conversion of solid cellulosic biomass to liquid biofuels may provide a renewable energy source for transportation fuels. Cellulolytic fungi represent a promising group of organisms, as they have evolved complex systems for adaptation to their tural habitat. The filamentous fungus Myceliophthora thermophila constitutes an exceptiolly powerful cellulolytic microorganism that synthesizes a complete set of enzymes necessary for the breakdown of plant cell wall. The genome of this fungus has been recently sequenced and annotated, allowing systematic examition and identification of enzymes required for the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass. The genomic alysis revealed the existence of an expanded enzymatic repertoire including numerous cellulases, hemicellulases, and enzymes with auxiliary activities, covering the most of the recognized CAZy families. Most of them were predicted to possess a secretion sigl and undergo through post-translatiol glycosylation modifications. These data offer a better understanding of activities embedded in fungal lignocellulose decomposition mechanisms and suggest that M. thermophila could be made USAble as an industrial production host for cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes.

24692305	Stability and kinetic behavior of immobilized laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila in the presence of the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethylsulfate	The use of ionic liquids (ILs) as reaction media for enzymatic reactions has increased their potential because they can improve enzyme activity and stability. Kinetic and stability properties of immobilized commercial laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila in the water-soluble IL 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethylsulfate ([emim][EtSO4 ]) have been studied and compared with free laccase. Laccase immobilization was carried out by covalent binding on glyoxyl-agarose beads. The immobilization yield was 100%, and the activity was totally recovered. The Michaelis-Menten model fitted well to the kinetic data of enzymatic oxidation of a model substrate in the presence of the IL [emim][EtSO4 ]. When concentration of the IL was augmented, the values of Vmax for free and immobilized laccases showed an increase and slight decrease, respectively. The laccase-glyoxyl-agarose derivative improved the laccase stability in comparison with the free laccase regarding the enzymatic ictivation in [emim][EtSO4 ]. The stability of both free and immobilized laccase was slightly affected by small amounts of IL (<50%). A high concentration of the IL (75%) produced a large ictivation of free laccase. However, immobilization prevented deactivation beyond 50%. Free and immobilized laccase showed a first-order thermal ictivation profile between 55 and 70 degrees C in the presence of the IL [emim][EtSO4 ]. Filly, thermal stability was scarcely affected by the presence of the IL.	1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethylsulfate, agarose, immobilization, ionic liquid, laccase, stability	Biotechnology progress	Dept. of Chemical Engineering, University of Vigo, Lagoas Marcosende, 36310, Vigo, Spain.

24401177	Pretreatment with laccase and a phenolic mediator degrades lignin and enhances saccharification of Eucalyptus feedstock	BACKGROUND: Biofuel production from lignocellulosic material is hampered by biomass recalcitrance towards enzymatic hydrolysis due to the compact architecture of the plant cell wall and the presence of lignin. The purpose of this work is to study the ability of an industrially available laccase-mediator system to modify and remove lignin during pretreatment of wood (Eucalyptus globulus) feedstock, thus improving saccharification, and to alyze the chemical modifications produced in the whole material and especially in the recalcitrant lignin moiety. RESULTS: Up to 50% lignin removal from ground eucalypt wood was attained by pretreatment with recombint Myceliophthora thermophila laccase and methyl syringate as mediator, followed by alkaline peroxide extraction in a multistage sequence. The lignin removal directly correlated with increases (approximately 40%) in glucose and xylose yields after enzymatic hydrolysis. The pretreatment using laccase alone (without mediator) removed up to 20% of lignin from eucalypt wood. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry of the pretreated wood revealed modifications of the lignin polymer, as shown by lignin markers with shortened side chains and increased syringyl-to-guaiacyl ratio. Additiol information on the chemical modifications produced was obtained by two-dimensiol nuclear magnetic resonce of the whole wood swollen in dimethylsulfoxide-d6. The spectra obtained revealed the removal of guaiacyl and syringyl lignin units, although with a preferential removal of the former, and the lower number of aliphatic side-chains per phenylpropane unit (involved in main beta-O-4' and beta-beta' inter-unit linkages), in agreement with the pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry results, without a substantial change in the wood polysaccharide sigls. However, the most noticeable modification observed in the spectra was the formation of Calpha-oxidized syringyl lignin units during the enzymatic treatment. Further insight into the modifications of lignin structure, affecting other inter-unit linkages and oxidized structures, was attained by nuclear magnetic resonce of the lignins isolated from the eucalypt feedstock after the enzymatic pretreatments. CONCLUSIONS: This work shows the potential of an oxidative enzymatic pretreatment to delignify and improve cellulase saccharification of a hardwood feedstock (eucalypt wood) when applied directly on the ground lignocellulosic material, and reveals the main chemical changes in the pretreated material, and its recalcitrant lignin moiety, behind the above results.

24362246	Production of Sporotrichum thermophile xylase by solid state fermentation utilizing deoiled Jatropha curcas seed cake and its application in xylooligosachharide synthesis	De-oiled Jatropha curcas seed cake, a plentiful by-product of biodiesel industry was used as substrate for the production of a useful xylase from Sporotrichum thermophile in solid state fermentation. Under the optimized conditions, 1025U xylase/g (deoiled seed cake) was produced. The xylase exhibited half life of 4h at 45 degrees C and 71.44min at 50 degrees C respectively. It was stable in a broad pH range of 7.0-11.0. Km and Vmax were 12.54mg/ml and 454.5U/ml/min respectively. S. thermophile xylase is an endoxylase free of exoxylase activity, hence advantageous for xylan hydrolysis to produce xylooligosachharides. Hydrolysis of oat spelt xylan by S. thermophile xylase yielded 73% xylotetraose, 15.4% xylotriose and 10% xylobiose. The S. thermophile endoxylase thus seem potentially useful in the food industries.

24929309	Production of cellobiose dehydrogese from a newly isolated white rot fungus Termitomyces sp. OE147	Class I cellobiose dehydrogeses (CDHs) are extracellular hemoflavo enzymes produced at low levels by the Basidiomycetes (white rot fungi). In presence of suitable electron acceptors, e.g., cytochrome c, 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol, or metal ions, it oxidizes cellobiose to cellobionolactone. A stringent requirement for disaccharides makes CDH also useful for conversion of lactose to lactobionic acid, an important ingredient in pharma and detergent industry. In this work, class I CDH was produced using a newly identified white rot fungus Termitomyces sp. OE147. Four media were evaluated for CDH production, and maximum enzyme activity of 0.92 intertiol unit (IU)/ml was obtained on Ludwig medium under submerged conditions. Statistical optimization of N source, which had significant effect on CDH production, using Box-Behnken design followed by optimization of inoculum size and age resulted in an increase in activity to 2.9 IU/ml and a productivity of ~25 IU/l/h. The nearly purified CDH exhibited high activity of 26.4 IU/mg protein on lactose indicating this enzyme to be useful for lactobionic acid synthesis. Some of the interl peptide sequences bore 100 % homology to the CDH produced in Myceliophthora thermophila. The fungal isolate was ameble to scale up, and an overall productivity of ~18 IU/l/h was obtained at 14-l level.

The putative endoglucase from the genomic D was successfully cloned in P. pastoris X-33 and the recombint enzyme was purified to its homogeneity (65 kDa) and subsequently characterized. Substrate specificity alysis revealed that the enzyme exhibits high activity on substrates containing beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds such as carboxymethyl cellulose, barley beta-glucan, and cello-oligosaccharides, as well as activity on xylan-containing substrates, including arabinoxylan and oat spelt xylan. MtEG7a was proved to liquefy rapidly and efficiently pretreated wheat straw, indicating its key role to the initial step of hydrolysis of high-solids lignocellulose substrates. High thermostability of the endoglucase reflects potential commercial significance of the enzyme.

24531271	Enzymatic synthesis of model substrates recognized by glucuronoyl esterases from Podospora anseri and Myceliophthora thermophila	Glucuronoyl esterases (GEs) are recently discovered enzymes that are suggested to cleave the ester bond between lignin alcohols and xylan-bound 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid. Although their potential use for enhanced enzymatic biomass degradation and synthesis of valuable chemicals renders them attractive research targets for biotechnological applications, the difficulty to purify tural fractions of lignin-carbohydrate complexes hampers the characterization of fungal GEs. In this work, we report the synthesis of three aryl alkyl or alkenyl D-glucurote esters using lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB) and their use to determine the kinetic parameters of two GEs, StGE2 from the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila (syn. Sporotrichum thermophile) and PaGE1 from the coprophilous fungus Podospora anseri. PaGE1 was functiolly expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris under the transcriptiol control of the alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter and purified to its homogeneity (63 kDa). The three D-glucurote esters contain an aromatic UV-absorbing phenol group that facilitates the quantification of their enzymatic hydrolysis by HPLC. Both enzymes were able to hydrolyze the synthetic esters with a pronounced preference towards the cinmyl-D-glucurote ester. The experimental results were corroborated by computatiol docking of the synthesized substrate alogues. We show that the ture of the alcohol portion of the hydrolyzed ester influences the catalytic efficiency of the two GEs.

24880600	Autochthonous ascomycetes in depollution of polychlorited biphenyls contamited soil and sediment	We investigated the capacity of a consortium of ascomycetous strains, Doratomyces nus, Doratomyces purpureofuscus, Doratomyces verrucisporus, Myceliophthora thermophila, Phoma eupyre and Thermoascus crustaceus in the mycoremediation of historically contamited soil and sediment by polychlorited biphenyls (PCBs). Alyses of 15 PCB concentrations in three mesocosms containing soil from which the fungal strains had previously been isolated, revealed significant PCB depletions of 16.9% for the 6 indicator PCBs (i-PCBs) and 18.7% for the total 15 PCBs alyzed after 6months treatment. The degradation rate did not statistically vary whether the soil had been treated with non-inoculated straw or colonized straw or without straw and inoculated with the consortium of the six strains. Concerning the sediment, we evidenced significant depletions of 31.8% for the 6 i-PCBs and 33.3% for the 15 PCB congeners. The PCB depletions affected most of the 15 PCBs alyzed without preference for lower chlorited congeners. Bioaugmented strains were evidenced in different mesocosms, but their reintroduction, after six months treatment, did not improve the rate of PCB degradation, suggesting that the biodegradation could affect the bioavailable PCB fraction. Our results demonstrate that the ascomycetous strains potentially adapted to PCBs may be propitious to the remediation of PCB contamited sites.

24128582	Laccase-catalysed oxidation of ferulic acid and ethyl ferulate in aqueous medium: a green procedure for the synthesis of new compounds	The enzymatic oxidation of ferulic acid (FA) and ethyl ferulate (EF) with Myceliophthora thermophila laccase, as biocatalyst, was performed in aqueous medium using an eco-friendly procedure to synthesize new active molecules. First, the commercial laccase was ultrafiltrated allowing for the elimition of phenolic contamints and increasing the specific activity by a factor of 2. Then, kinetic parameters of this laccase were determined for both substrates (FA, EF), indicating a higher substrate affinity for ethyl ferulate. Additiolly, enzymatic oxidation led to the synthesis of a FA-major product, exhibiting a molecular mass of 386 g/mol and a EF-major product with a molecular mass of 442 g/mol. Structural alyses by mass spectrometry allowed the identification of dimeric derivatives. The optical properties of the oxidation products showed the increase of red and yellow colours, with FA-products compared to EF-products. Additiolly, enzymatic oxidation led to a decrease of antioxidant and cytotoxic activities compared to initial substrates. Consequently, this enzymatic procedure in aqueous medium could provide new compounds presenting optical, antioxidant and cytotoxic interest.

24881579	Transcriptome and exoproteome alysis of utilization of plant-derived biomass by Myceliophthora thermophila	Myceliophthora thermophila is a thermophilic fungus whose genome encodes a wide range of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) involved in plant biomass degradation. Such enzymes have potential applications in turning different kinds of lignocellulosic feedstock into sugar precursors for biofuels and chemicals. The present study examined and compared the transcriptomes and exoproteomes of M. thermophila during cultivation on different types of complex biomass to gain insight into how its secreted enzymatic machinery varies with different sources of lignocellulose. In the transcriptome alysis three monocot (barley, oat, triticale) and three dicot (alfalfa, canola, flax) plants were used whereas in the proteome alysis additiol substrates, i.e. wood and corn stover pulps, were included. A core set of 59 genes encoding CAZymes was up-regulated in response to both monocot and dicot straws, including nine polysaccharide monooxygeses and GH10, but not GH11, xylases. Genes encoding additiol xylanolytic enzymes were up-regulated during growth on monocot straws, while genes encoding additiol pectinolytic enzymes were up-regulated in response to dicot biomass. Exoproteome alysis was generally consistent with the conclusions drawn from transcriptome alysis, but additiol CAZymes that accumulated to high levels were identified. Despite the wide variety of biomass sources tested some CAZy family members were not expressed under any condition. The results of this study provide a comprehensive view from both transcriptome and exoproteome levels, of how M. thermophila responds to a wide range of biomass sources using its genomic resources.

24948946	Filamentous fungi and media for cellulase production in solid state cultures	Cellulase production was evaluated in two reference strains (T. reesei Rut-C30 and T. reesei QM9414), two strains isolated from a sugarcane cultivation area (Trichoderma sp. IPT778 and T. harzianum rifai IPT821) and one strain isolated in a program for biodiversity preservation in Sao Paulo state (Myceliophthora thermophila M77). Solid state cultures were performed using sugarcane bagasse (C), wheat bran (W) and/or soybean bran (S). The highest FPA was 10.6 U/gdm for M77 in SC (10:90) at 80% moisture, which was 4.4 times higher than production in pure W. C was a strong inducer of cellulase production, given that the production level of 6.1 U/gdm in WC (40:60) was 2.5 times higher than in pure W for strain M77; T. reesei Rut-C30 did not respond as strongly with about 1.6-fold surplus production. S advantageously replaced W, as the surplus production on SC (20:80) was 2.3 times relative to WC (20:80) for M77.

25135636	Evolutiorily conserved roles of the dicer helicase domain in regulating R interference processing	The enzyme Dicer generates 21-25 nucleotide Rs that target specific mRs for silencing during R interference and related pathways. Although their active sites and R binding regions are functiolly conserved, the helicase domains have distinct activities in the context of different Dicer enzymes. To examine the evolutiory origins of Dicer helicase functions, we investigated two related Dicer enzymes from the thermophilic fungus Sporotrichum thermophile. R cleavage assays showed that S. thermophile Dicer-1 (StDicer-1) can process hairpin precursor microRs, whereas StDicer-2 can only cleave linear double-stranded Rs. Furthermore, only StDicer-2 possesses robust ATP hydrolytic activity in the presence of double-stranded R. Deletion of the StDicer-2 helicase domain increases both StDicer-2 cleavage activity and affinity for hairpin R. Notably, both StDicer-1 and StDicer-2 could complement the distantly related yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe lacking its endogenous Dicer gene but only in their full-length forms, underscoring the importance of the helicase domain. These results suggest an in vivo regulatory function for the helicase domain that may be conserved from fungi to humans.

23715853	Cleavage and synthesis function of high and low redox potential laccases towards 4-morpholinoaniline and amited as well as chlorited phenols	Laccases are able to mediate both cleavage and synthesis processes. The basis for this dual reaction capability lies in the property of the enzyme laccase to oxidize phenolic, and to some extent non-phenolic substances, to reactive radicals which can undergo on the one hand separations of small substitutents or large molecule parts from the parent compound and on the other hand coupling reactions with other radicals or molecules which are not themselves oxidizable by laccase. The cleavage of the non-phenolic compound 4-morpholinoaniline as well as the deamition of 4-aminophenol and the dechlorition of 4-chlorophenol resulted in the formation of 1,4-hydroquinone which is immediately oxidized by laccase to 1,4-benzoquinone. The formation of the 1,4-hydroquinone/1,4-benzoquinone is the rate limiting step for the synthesis of the heteromolecular dimers and trimers composed of 1,4-benzoquinone and one or two molecules of morpholine. In addition to the synthesis of new compounds from the cleavage products, 4-morpholinoaniline polymerized probably via azo groups and C-N bonds to a homomolecular dimer and trimer. Similarities and differences in cleavage and synthesis reactions catalyzed by the low redox potential laccase of Myceliophthora thermophila (0.46 V) and the high redox potential laccase of Pycnoporus cinbarinus (0.79 V) were determined. In addition, the dependency of the cleavage and synthesis efficiencies on the (a) structure and redox potential of the laccase, (b) structure and redox potential of the substrate, (c) pH value of the buffer used, (d) incubation temperature, (e) solvent concentration, and (f) laccase activity is discussed in general.

23795296	Scaffold nucleoporins Nup188 and Nup192 share structural and functiol properties with nuclear transport receptors	Nucleocytoplasmic transport is mediated by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) embedded in the nuclear envelope. About 30 different proteins (nucleoporins, nups) arrange around a central eightfold rotatiol axis to build the modular NPC. Nup188 and Nup192 are related and evolutiory conserved, large nucleoporins that are part of the NPC scaffold. Here we determine the structure of Nup188. The protein folds into an extended stack of helices where an N-termil 130 kDa segment forms an intricate closed ring, while the C-termil region is a more regular, superhelical structure. Overall, the structure has distant similarity with flexible S-shaped nuclear transport receptors (NTRs). Intriguingly, like NTRs, both Nup188 and Nup192 specifically bind FG-repeats and are able to translocate through NPCs by facilitated diffusion. This blurs the existing dogma of a clear distinction between statiory nups and soluble NTRs and suggests an evolutiory relationship between the NPC and the soluble nuclear transport machinery.

23911459	The influence of the primary and secondary xanthan structure on the enzymatic hydrolysis of the xanthan backbone	Differently modified xanthans, varying in degree of acetylation and/or pyruvylation were incubated with the experimental cellulase mixture C1-G1 from Myceliophthora thermophila C1. The ionic strength and/or temperature of the xanthan solutions were varied, to obtain different xanthan conformations. The exact conformation at the selected incubation conditions was determined by circular dichroism. The xanthan degradation was alyzed by size exclusion chromatography. It was shown that at a fixed xanthan conformation, the backbone degradation by cellulases is equal for each type of xanthan. Complete backbone degradation is only obtained at a fully disordered conformation, indicating that only the secondary xanthan structure influences the fil degree of hydrolysis by cellulases. It is thereby shown that, independently on the degree of substitution, xanthan can be completely hydrolyzed to oligosaccharides. These oligosaccharides can be used to further investigate the primary structure of different xanthans and to correlate the molecular structure to the xanthan functiolities.

23683701	Two novel GH11 endo-xylases from Myceliophthora thermophila C1 act differently toward soluble and insoluble xylans	Two novel GH11 endo-xylases from Myceliophthora thermophila C1 (C1), Xyl7 and Xyl8, were purified and the influence of solubility and molecular structure of various xylans on their efficiency was investigated. Both endo-xylases were hindered by a high degree of substitution of a xylan. The two GH11 xylases released different products from the xylans, in which Xyl7 displayed a degradation product composition closer to GH10 xylases. A correlation of the degradation product composition with a specific residue at position 163 in the amino acid sequence of Xyl8 is suggested: tyrosine in Xyl8; valine in Xyl7. This is confirmed with examples of various endo-xylases reported in literature. The C1 GH11 xylases were more efficient on self-associated xylan compared to C1 GH10 endo-xylases and they released more small xylooligomers from these xylans. This is contrary to the general assumption that GH10 xylases degrade xylans to a higher degree than GH11 xylases.

23841747	Understanding pulp delignification by laccase-mediator systems through isolation and characterization of lignin-carbohydrate complexes	The effects and mechanism of pulp delignification by laccases in the presence of redox mediators have been investigated on unbleached eucalyptus kraft pulp treated with laccases from Pycnoporus cinbarinus (PcL) and Myceliophthora thermophila (MtL) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) and methyl syringate (MeS) as mediators, respectively. Determition of the corrected kappa number in eucalyptus pulps after the enzymatic treatments revealed that the PcL-HBT system exhibited a more remarkable delignification effect than the MtL-MeS system. To obtain further insight, lignin-carbohydrate complexes were fractioted and subsequently characterized by nuclear magnetic resonce, thioacidolysis (followed by gas chromatography and size exclusion chromatography), and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (pyrolysis-GC-MS) alyses before and after the enzymatic treatments and their controls. We can conclude that the laccase-mediator treatments altered the lignin structures in such a way that more lignin was recovered in the xylan-lignin fractions, as shown by Klason lignin estimation, with smaller amounts of both syringyl (S) and guaiacyl (G) uncondensed units, as shown by thioacidolysis and gas chromatography, especially after the PcL-HBT treatment. The laccase-mediator treatment produced oxidation at Calpha and cleavage of Calpha and Cbeta bonds in pulp lignin, as shown by pyrolysis-GC-MS. The general mechanism of residual lignin degradation in the pulp by laccase-mediator treatments is discussed in light of the results obtained.

23218295	Obtaining biobleached eucalyptus cellulose fibres by using various enzyme combitions	Various combitions of laccases, xylase and cellulase were used to biobleach cellulose fibres from eucalyptus. The Trametes villosa and Myceliophthora thermophila laccases were used in combition with violuric acid (VA(TvL) system) and methyl syringate (MeS(MtL) system), respectively, as mediator. A dissimilar mode of action of the two systems was found: the VA(TvL) treatment released both hexenuronic acids and lignin, whereas the MeS(MtL) released lignin alone. Pulp properties were further improved by applying the mediator before the enzyme during treatment. Pulp properties comparable to those provided by industrial TCF sequences were obtained by inserting a xylase pretreatment before VA(TvL), but no significant effect was observed after the cellulase pretreatment. As an added value, the resulting enzymatically bleached fibres possess a reduced hexenuronic acid content. The chemical oxygen demand of the effluents from each stage was also assessed.

23360704	Polymerisation of Kraft lignin from black liquors by laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila: effect of operatiol conditions and black liquor origin	The capacity of laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila to promote the oxidative polymerisation of Kraft lignin (KL) was evaluated in several conditions of pH, temperature, enzyme dosage and treatment time. Moreover, different black liquors from the Kraft cooking of Eucalyptus globulus and mixture of Pinus pister/E. globulus were evaluated in order to determine the effect of the KL source on the polymerisation reaction. Furthermore, one of these black liquors was fractioted by sequential organic solvent fractiotion and the polymerisation of the corresponding fractions was tested. Polymerisation products were alysed by size exclusion chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results provide evidence of notable lignin modifications after incubation with laccase. Structural oxidation and a notably molecular weight increase were attained, reaching a polymer of 69-fold its initial molecular weight depending on the raw lignin. Moreover, optimum values of reaction conditions were obtained: pH 7.3, 70 degrees C, 2UmL(-1) and 2h.

23570533	Laccase-mediated coupling of nonpolar chains for the hydrophobization of lignocellulose	We investigate the use of laccase enzymes to couple short nonpolar chains containing aromatic groups onto flax fibers and nofibrillated cellulose (NFC) with different lignin contents. Trametes villosa , Pycnoporus cinbarinus , and Myceliophthora thermophila were used to facilitate surface coupling and to produce materials with different levels of hydrophobicity. Heat treatment of fiber webs after lacccase-mediated coupling markedly increased the resistance to water absorption. The highest hydrophobization levels of flax fibers was achieved by coupling dodecyl 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate (HB-C12), which yielded water contact angles (WCAs) of 80-96 degrees and water absorption times (drop tests) of ca. 73 min. The results from apparent aromatic content and FTIR alyses confirmed the laccase-mediated coupling of HB-C12 onto the cellulose fibers. Ultrathin films of NFC were also used as substrates for enzyme-mediated hydrophobization with HB-C12. In these cases, WCAs in the range of 87-104 degrees were achieved, depending on the conditions. Quartz crystal microgravimetry (QCM) was used to study the dymics and the extent of the coupling process onto cellulose. The results help to better understand the mechanisms involved in laccase-mediated hydrophobization and provide a proof of a biotechnological platform for the development of value-added fiber products.

23788272	Membraneless glucose/oxygen enzymatic fuel cells using redox hydrogel films containing carbon notubes	Co-immobilisation of three separate multiple blue copper oxygeses, a Myceliophthora thermophila laccase, a Streptomyces coelicolor laccase and a Myrothecium verrucaria bilirubin oxidase, with an [Os(2,2'-bipyridine)2 (polyvinylimidazole)10Cl](+/2+) redox polymer in the presence of multi-walled carbon notubes (MWCNTs) on graphite electrodes results in enzyme electrodes that produce current densities above 0.5 mA cm(-2) for oxygen reduction at an applied potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl. Fully enzymatic membraneless fuel cells are assembled with the oxygen-reducing enzyme electrodes connected to glucose-oxidising anodes based on co-immobilisation of glucose oxidase or a flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent glucose dehydrogese with an [Os(4,4'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine)2(polyvinylimidazole)10Cl](+/2+) redox polymer in the presence of MWCNTs on graphite electrodes. These fuel cells can produce power densities of up to 145 muW cm(-2) on operation in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer solution at 37  degrees C containing 150 mM Cl, 5 mM glucose and 0.12 mM O2. The fuel cells based on Myceliophthora thermophila laccase enzyme electrodes produce the highest power density if combined with glucose oxidase-based anodes. Although the maximum power density of a fuel cell of glucose dehydrogese and Myceliophthora thermophila laccase enzyme electrodes decreases from 110 muW cm(-2) in buffer to 60 muW cm(-2) on testing in artificial plasma, it provides the highest power output reported to date for a fully enzymatic glucose-oxidising, oxygen-reducing fuel cell in artificial plasma.	enzyme electrodes, fuel cells, glucose oxidation, oxygen reduction, redox chemistry	Chemphyschem : a European journal of chemical physics and physical chemistry	School of Chemistry & Ryan Institute, National University of Ireland Galway, University Road, Galway, Ireland.

23638383	Cloning, expression and characterization of an ethanol tolerant GH3 beta-glucosidase from Myceliophthora thermophila	The beta-glucosidase gene bgl3a from Myceliophthora thermophila, member of the fungal glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family 3, was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The mature beta-glucosidase gene, which results after the excision of one intron and the secreting sigl peptide, was placed under the control of the strong alcohol oxidase promoter (AOX1) in the plasmid pPICZalphaC. The recombint enzyme (90 kDa) was purified and characterized in order to evaluate its biotechnological potential. Recombint P. pastoris efficiently secreted beta-glucosidase into the medium and produced high level of enzymatic activity (41 U/ml) after 192 h of growth, under methanol induction. MtBgl3a was able to hydrolyze low molecular weight substrates and polysaccharides containing beta-glucosidic residues. The K m was found to be 0.39 mM on p-beta-NPG and 2.64 mM on cellobiose. Optimal pH and temperature for the p-beta-NPG hydrolysis were 5.0 and 70  degrees C. The beta-glucosidase exhibits a half life of 143 min at 60  degrees C. Kinetic parameters of inhibition were determined for D-glucose, D-xylose and D-gluconic acid, indicating tolerance of the enzyme for these sugars and oxidized products. The recombint enzyme was stimulated by short chain alcohols and has been shown to efficiently synthesize methyl-D-glucoside in the presence of methanol due to its transglycosylation activity. The stability of MtBgl3a in ethanol was prominent, and it retained most of its origil activity after we exposed it to 50% ethanol for 6 h. The high catalytic performance, good thermal stability and tolerance to elevated concentrations of ethanol, D-xylose and D-glucose qualify this enzyme for use in the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass for biofuel production, as part of an efficient complete multi-enzyme cocktail.

23275164	The structure of a novel glucuronoyl esterase from Myceliophthora thermophila gives new insights into its role as a potential biocatalyst	The increasing demand for the development of efficient biocatalysts is a consequence of their broad industrial applications. Typical difficulties that are encountered during their exploitation in a variety of processes are interconnected with factors such as temperature, pH, product inhibitors etc. To elimite these, research has been directed towards the identification of new enzymes that would comply with the required standards. To this end, the recently discovered glucuronoyl esterases (GEs) are an enigmatic family within the carbohydrate esterase (CE) family. Structures of the thermophilic StGE2 esterase from Myceliophthora thermophila (synonym Sporotrichum thermophile), a member of the CE15 family, and its S213A mutant were determined at 1.55 and 1.9 A resolution, respectively. The first crystal structure of the S213A mutant in complex with a substrate alogue, methyl 4-O-methyl-beta-D-glucopyranurote, was determined at 2.35 A resolution. All of the three-dimensiol protein structures have an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold with a three-layer alphabetaalpha-sandwich architecture and a Rossmann topology and comprise one molecule per asymmetric unit. These are the first crystal structures of a thermophilic GE both in an unliganded form and bound to a substrate alogue, thus unravelling the organization of the catalytic triad residues and their neighbours lining the active site. The knowledge derived offers novel insights into the key structural elements that drive the hydrolysis of glucuronic acid esters.		Acta crystallographica.

23622721	Potential of autochthonous fungal strains isolated from contamited soils for degradation of polychlorited biphenyls	Up to now, most studies on polychlorited biphenyl (PCB) bioremediation have examined the ability of model fungal strains to biodegrade PCBs. Yet, there is limited information concerning the potential of autochthonous filamentous fungal strains in the biodegradation of PCBs and their possible use in the environmental technologies. In this study, we investigated the capacity of autochthonous fungal strains in the biodegradation of PCBs by isolating 24 taxa from former industrial sites highly contamited by PCBs. Microscopic and molecular alyses using the interl transcribed spacer (ITS) region revealed that the fungal strains belonged to the phyla Ascomycota (19 strains) and Zygomycota (five strains). The chromatography gas alysis revealed evidence of degradation of seven PCB congeners. With the exception of Circinella muscae which presented no degradation potential, the other fungal strains exhibited a rate of biodegradation ranging from 29 to 85 % after 7 d of incubation in liquid medium. Among these strains, Doratomyces nus, Doratomyces purpureofuscus, Doratomyces verrucisporus, Myceliophthora thermophila, Phoma eupyre, and Thermoascus crustaceus showed remarkable degradation ability (>70 %) regardless of the number of chlorine substituents on the biphenyl nucleus and a high tolerance towards PCBs. To our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates the ability of PCB degradation by these species and indicates the potential effectiveness of some autochthonous fungal strains in bioremediation systems.

22728192	Two GH10 endo-xylases from Myceliophthora thermophila C1 with and without cellulose binding module act differently towards soluble and insoluble xylans	Xylases are mostly classified as belonging to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 10 and 11, which differ in catalytic properties and structures. However, within one family, differences may also be present. The influence of solubility and molecular structure of substrates towards the efficiency of two GH10 xylases from Myceliophthora thermophila C1 was investigated. The xylases differed in degradation of high and low substituted substrate and the substitution pattern was an important factor influencing their efficiency. Alkali-labile interactions, as well as the presence of cellulose within the complex cell wall structure hindered efficient hydrolysis for both xylases. The presence of a carbohydrate binding module did not enhance the degradation of the substrates. The differences in degradation could be related to the protein structure of the two xylases. The study shows that the classification of enzymes does not predict their performance towards various substrates.		Bioresource technology	Laboratory of Food Chemistry, Wageningen University, P.O.

22858477	Enzymatic polymerisation and effect of fractiotion of dissolved lignin from Eucalyptus globulus Kraft liquor	The potential ability of the laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila, either alone or with low molecular weight (LMW) additives, to polymerise a dissolved lignin from Kraft liquor of eucalypt cooking was investigated. A previous study of enzymatic performance (activity and stability) was carried out using a design experiment methodology. In addition, Kraft dissolved lignin (KDL) was fractioted according to two different protocols (solvent extraction and acidic fractiotion) in order to identify possible lignin fractions with noticeable polymerisation ability. KDL and its corresponding lignin fractions were treated with laccase and alysed by size exclusion chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results provide conclusive evidence of notable lignin modifications after incubation with laccase. Moreover, lignin fractiotion allows to obtain lignin fractions with different chemical characteristics and polymerisation capability. Depending on the type of raw lignin, molecular weight can increase from 4- to 21-fold by means of laccase polymerisation.

22342900	Degradation of estrogens by laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila in fed-batch and enzymatic membrane reactors	Several studies reported that tural and synthetic estrogens are the major contributors to the estrogenic activity associated with the effluents of wastewater treatment plants. The ability of the enzyme laccase to degrade these compounds in batch experiments has been demonstrated in previous studies. Nevertheless, information is scarce regarding in vitro degradation of estrogens in continuous enzymatic bioreactors. The present work constitutes an important step forward for the implementation of an enzymatic reactor for the continuous removal of estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) by free laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila. In a first step, the effect of the main process parameters (pH, enzyme level, gas composition (air or oxygen) and estrogen feeding rate) were evaluated in fed-batch bioreactors. E1 and E2 were oxidized by 94.1 and 95.5%, respectively, under the best conditions evaluated. Thereafter, an enzymatic membrane reactor (EMR) was developed to perform the continuous degradation of the estrogens. The configuration consisted of a stirred tank reactor coupled with an ultrafiltration membrane, which allowed the recovery of enzyme while both estrogens and degradation products could pass through it. The highest removal rates at steady state conditions were up to 95% for E1 and nearly complete degradation for E2. Furthermore, the residual estrogenic activity of the effluent was largely reduced up to 97%.

22038613	Immobilisation of laccase on Eupergit supports and its application for the removal of endocrine disrupting chemicals in a packed-bed reactor	Laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila was covalently immobilised on Eupergit C and Eupergit C 250L yielding specific activities of up to 17 and 80 U/g, respectively. Due to its superior activity, Eupergit C 250L was chosen for further research. The somewhat lower catalytic efficiency (based on the ratio between the turnover number and the Michaelis constant, k(cat)/K(M)) of the immobilised enzyme in comparison with that of the free enzyme was balanced by its increased stability and broader operatiol window related to temperature and pH. The feasibility of the immobilised laccase was tested by using a packed bed reactor (PBR) operating in consecutive cycles for the removal of Acid Green 27 dye as model substrate. High degrees of elimition were achieved (88, 79, 69 and 57% in 4 consecutive cycles), while the levels of adsorption on the support varied from 18 to 6%, proving that dye removal took place mainly due to the action of the enzyme. Filly, a continuous PBR with the solid biocatalyst was applied for the treatment of a solution containing the following endocrine disrupting chemicals: estrone (E1), 17beta-estradiol (E2) and 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2). At steady-state operation, E1 was degraded by 65% and E2 and EE2 were removed up to 80% and only limited adsorption of these compounds on the support, between 12 and 22%, was detected. In addition, a 79% decrease in estrogenic activity was detected in the effluent of the enzymatic reactor while only 14% was attained by ictivated laccase.

22436888	Structural features of beta-(1-->4)-D-galactomanns of plant origin as a probe for beta-(1-->4)-manse polymeric substrate specificity	Statistical modeling was applied for describing structural features of beta-(1-->4)-D-galactomanns. According to the model suggested theoretical ratios of limiting degrees of locust bean, tara gum and guar gum galactomann conversions by two beta-(1-->4)-manses of different origin (Myceliophthora thermophila and Trichoderma reesei) were calculated. Then the enzymes were tested for enzymatic hydrolysis of three considered galactomanns. Experimentally observed results were compared with theoretically calculated ones. It was shown that T. reesei beta-manse attacks sequences of four and more unsubstituted mannopyranosyl residues in a row, while M. thermophila beta-manse is a more specific enzyme and attacks sequences of five and more mannopyranosyl residues in a row. Considered statistical model and approach allows to characterize both galactomann structures and enzyme requirements for regions of unsubstituted mannose residues for substrate hydrolysis.

22633202	Thermal deturation of a blue-copper laccase: formation of a compact detured state with residual structure linked to pH changes in the region of histidine prototion	The partial (absolute) heat capacity of a laccase enzyme from Myceliophthora thermophila (MtL) was determined from calorimetric scans in the 4.5-10.0 pH range. Above pH 7.5, the heat capacity of the thermally detured state (C(p)(D)) of this blue-copper glycoprotein is consistent with that for an unfolded, fully solvated polypeptide chain, if its carbohydrate content is taken into account. Below pH 7.5, C(p)(D) decreases and eventually levels off within the 5.5-4.5 pH region, where a compact, partially solvated detured state is formed. In the compact state, detured MtL is an oligomer, and exhibits considerable tive-like secondary structure and a perturbed environment of its copper atoms. Alysis of the pH dependence of C(p)(D) and the content of secondary structure gives results implying that His residues play an important role in the stability of the compact detured state.

22342036	Lignin boosts the cellulase performance of a GH-61 enzyme from Sporotrichum thermophile	An enzyme belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family 61 from the thermophilic fungus Sporotrichum thermophile, was functiolly expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris under the transcriptiol control of the alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter. The enzyme hydrolyzed barley beta-glucan, carboxymethyl cellulose, lichen, wheat arabinoxylan and birchwood xylan showing optimal activity at pH 8 and 65 degrees C. A 2:1 mixture of Celluclast 1.5L and StCel61a was capable of increasing the degree of spruce conversion by 42%. The use of substrates with varying lignin content permitted the detection of a dependence of the enhancing capacity of StCel61a on the radical scavenging capacity of the different lignocellulosics. In the presence of a reductant, StCel61a boosted the efficiency of a mixture of purified cellulases (EGII, CBHI, beta-GLUC) by 20%. The synergistic activity exhibited by StCel61a and its dependence on reducing substances provide guidelines for process design towards the production of economically viable bioethanol.

22012339	Expression, characterization and structural modelling of a feruloyl esterase from the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila	A ferulic acid esterase (FAE) from the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila (synonym Sporotrichum thermophile), belonging to the carbohydrate esterase family 1 (CE-1), was functiolly expressed in methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The putative FAE from the genomic D was successfully cloned in P. pastoris X-33 to confirm that the enzyme exhibits FAE activity. The recombint FAE was purified to its homogeneity (39 kDa) and subsequently characterized using a series of model substrates including methyl esters of hydroxycinmates, alkyl ferulates and monoferuloylated 4-nitrophenyl glycosides. The substrate specificity profiling reveals that the enzyme shows a preference for the hydrolysis of methyl caffeate and p-coumarate and a strong preference for the hydrolysis of n-butyl and iso-butyl ferulate. The enzyme was active on substrates containing ferulic acid ester linked to the C-5 and C-2 linkages of arabinofuranose, whilst it was found capable of de-esterifying acetylated glucuronoxylans. Ferulic acid (FA) was efficiently released from destarched wheat bran when the esterase was incubated together with an M3 xylase from Trichoderma longibrachiatum (a maximum of 41% total FA released after 1 h incubation). Prediction of the secondary structure of MtFae1a was performed in the PSIPRED server whilst modelling the 3D structure was accomplished by the use of the HH 3D structure prediction server.

21710260	Recombint expression, activity screening and functiol characterization identifies three novel endo-1,4-beta-glucases that efficiently hydrolyse cellulosic substrates	The hydrolysis of cellulose into fermentable sugars is a costly and rate-limiting step in the production of biofuels from renewable feedstocks. Developing new cellulase systems capable of increased cellulose hydrolysis rates would reduce biofuel production costs. With this in mind, we screened 55 fungal endoglucases for their abilities to be expressed at high levels by Aspergillus niger and to hydrolyze amorphous cellulose at rates significantly greater than that obtained with TrCel5A, one of the major endoglucases in the Trichoderma reesei cellulase system. This screen identified three endoglucases, Aureobasidium pullulans ApCel5A, Gloeophyllum trabeum GtCel12A and Sporotrichum thermophile StCel5A. We determined that A. niger expressed the three endoglucases at relatively high levels (>/=0.3 g/l) and that the hydrolysis rate of ApCel5A and StCel5A with carboxymethylcellulose 4M as substrate was five and two times greater than the T. reesei Cel5A. The ApCel5A, GtCel12A and StCel5A enzymes also demonstrated significant synergy with Cel7A/CbhI, the major exoglucase in the T. reesei cellulase system. The three endoglucases characterized in this study are, therefore, promising candidate endoglucases for developing new cellulase systems with increased rates of cellulose saccharification.

24031929	Selection of thermophilic and thermotolerant fungi for the production of cellulases and xylases under solid-state fermentation	Twenty-seven thermophilic and thermotolerant fungal strains were isolated from soil, decaying organic matter and sugarcane piles based on their ability to grow at 45 degrees C on medium containing corn straw and cardboard as carbon sources. These fungi were identified in the genera Aspergillus, Thermomyces, Myceliophthora, Thermomucor and Candida. The majority of the isolated strains produced xylase and cellulases under solid state fermentation (SSF). The highest cellulase and xylase productions were obtained by the cultivation of the strains identified as Aspergillus fumigatus M.7.1 and Myceliophthora thermophila M.7.7. The enzymes from these strains exhibited maximum activity at pH 5.0 and at 60 and 70 masculineC. The endo-glucase from A. fumigatus was stable from 40 degrees C to 65 degrees C and both endo-glucase and xylase from M. thermophila were stable in this temperature range when in absence of substrate. The enzymes were stable from pH 4.0 to 9.0.

21075873	Extracellular aldonolactose from Myceliophthora thermophila	Fungi secrete many different enzymes to deconstruct lignocellulosic biomass, including several families of hydrolases, oxidative enzymes, and many uncharacterized proteins. Here we describe the isolation, characterization, and primary sequence alysis of an extracellular aldonolactose from the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila (synonym Sporotrichum thermophile). The lactose is a 48-kDa glycoprotein with a broad pH optimum. The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucono-delta-lactone and cellobiono-delta-lactone with an apparent second-order rate constant, k(cat)/K(m), of ~1 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1) at pH 5.0 and 25 degrees C but is uble to hydrolyze xylono-gamma-lactone or arabino-gamma-lactone. Sequence alyses of the lactose show that it has distant homology to cis-carboxy-mucote lactonizing enzymes (CMLE) as well as 6-phosphogluconolactoses present in some bacteria. The M. thermophila genome contains two predicted extracellular lactose genes, and expression of both genes is induced by the presence of pure cellulose. Homologues of the M. thermophila lactose, which are also predicted to be extracellular, are present in nearly all known cellulolytic ascomycetes.

21964414	Comparative genomic alysis of the thermophilic biomass-degrading fungi Myceliophthora thermophila and Thielavia terrestris	Thermostable enzymes and thermophilic cell factories may afford economic advantages in the production of many chemicals and biomass-based fuels. Here we describe and compare the genomes of two thermophilic fungi, Myceliophthora thermophila and Thielavia terrestris. To our knowledge, these genomes are the first described for thermophilic eukaryotes and the first complete telomere-to-telomere genomes for filamentous fungi. Genome alyses and experimental data suggest that both thermophiles are capable of hydrolyzing all major polysaccharides found in biomass. Examition of transcriptome data and secreted proteins suggests that the two fungi use shared approaches in the hydrolysis of cellulose and xylan but distinct mechanisms in pectin degradation. Characterization of the biomass-hydrolyzing activity of recombint enzymes suggests that these organisms are highly efficient in biomass decomposition at both moderate and high temperatures. Furthermore, we present evidence suggesting that aside from representing a potential reservoir of thermostable enzymes, thermophilic fungi are ameble to manipulation using classical and molecular genetics.

21524087	Evaluation of the potential of fungal and plant laccases for active-packaging applications	Laccases from Trametes versicolor (TvL), Myceliophthora thermophila (MtL), and Rhus vernicifera (RvL) were investigated with regard to their potential utilization as oxygen scavengers in active packages containing food susceptible to oxidation reactions. The substrate selectivity of the laccases was investigated with a set of 17 reducing substrates, mainly phenolic compounds. The temperature dependence of reactions performed at low temperatures (4-31  degrees C) was studied. Furthermore, the laccases were subjected to immobilization in a latex/clay matrix and drying procedures performed at temperatures up to 105  degrees C. The results show that it is possible to immobilize the laccases with retained activity after dispersion coating, drying at 75-105  degrees C, and subsequent storage of the enzyme-containing films at 4  degrees C. TvL and, to some extent, MtL were promiscuous with regard to their reducing substrate, in the sense that the difference in activity with the 17 substrates tested was relatively small. RvL, on the other hand, showed high selectivity, primarily toward substrates resembling its tural substrate urushiol. When tested at 7  degrees C, all three laccases retained >20% of the activity they had at 25  degrees C, which suggests that it would be possible to utilize the laccases also in refrigerated food packages. Coating and drying resulted in a remaining enzymatic activity ranging from 18 to 53%, depending on the drying conditions used. The results indicate that laccases are useful for active-packaging applications and that the selectivity for reducing substrates is an important characteristic of laccases from different sources.

21511459	Towards industrially-feasible delignification and pitch removal by treating paper pulp with Myceliophthora thermophila laccase and a phenolic mediator	The ability of two tural phenols to act as mediators of the recombint Myceliophthora thermophila laccase (MtL) in eucalypt-pulp delignification was investigated. After alkaline peroxide extraction, the properties of the enzymatically-treated pulps improved with respect to the control. The pulp brightness increased (3.1 points) after the enzymatic treatment with MtL alone, but the highest improvements were obtained after the MtL treatment using syringaldehyde (4.7 points) and especially methyl syringate (8.3 points) as mediators. Likewise, a decrease in kappa number up to 2.7 points was obtained after the MtL-methyl syringate treatment, followed by decreases of 1.4 and 0.9 points after the treatments with MtL-syringaldehyde and MtL alone, respectively. On the other hand, removal of the main lipophilic extractives present in eucalypt pulp was observed after the above laccase-mediator treatments. Filly, the doses of both MtL and methyl syringate were reduced, and results compatible with industrial implementation were obtained.

21919219	Immobilization of laccase by encapsulation in a sol-gel matrix and its characterization and use for the removal of estrogens	Laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila was immobilized by encapsulation in a sol-gel matrix based on methyltrimethoxysilane and tetramethoxysilane. The amount of laccase used for the preparation of the hydrogel was in the range 2.2-22 mg of protein/mL sol and the corresponding enzymatic activities were in the range 5.5-17.0 U/g biocatalyst. The kinetic parameters of the encapsulated laccase showed that the immobilized enzyme presented lower affinity for the substrate 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfote) (ABTS). However, the stability of laccase was significantly enhanced after immobilization; thus, both pH and thermal stability improved about 10-30% and tolerance to different ictivating agents (N(3) , ZnCl(2) , CoCl(2) , CaCl(2) , methanol, and acetone) was 20-40% higher. The reUSAbility of the immobilized laccase was demonstrated in the oxidation of ABTS for several consecutive cycles, preserving 80% of the initial laccase activity after 10 cycles. The feasibility of the immobilized biocatalyst was tested for the continuous elimition of Acid Green 27 dye as a model compound in a packed-bed reactor (PBR). Removals of 70, 58, 57, and 55% were achieved after four consecutive cycles with limited adsorption on the support: only 10-15%. Filly, both batch stirred tank reactor (BSTR) operated in several cycles and PBR, containing the solid biocatalyst were applied for the treatment of a solution containing the endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs): estrone (E1), 17beta-estradiol (E2), and 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2). Elimitions of EDCs in the BSTR were higher than 85% and the reUSAbility of the biocatalyst for the degradation of those estrogens was demonstrated. In the continuous operation of the PBR, E1 was degraded by 55% and E2 and EE2 were removed up to 75 and 60%, at steady-state conditions. In addition, a 63% decrease in estrogenic activity was detected.

20953600	Polyoxometalate/laccase-mediated oxidative polymerization of catechol for textile dyeing	The synergistic effect between polyoxometalates (POMs), mely K(5)[SiW(11)V(V)O(40)].11H(2)O and H(5)[PMo(10)V(V) (2)O(40)].13H(2)O and laccase from ascomycete Myceliophthora thermophila has been employed for the first time in oxidative polymerization of catechol. Such a laccase-mediator system allowed the formation of a relatively high molecular weight polycatechol as confirmed by size exclusion chromatography and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (3990 Da when using K(5)[SiW(11)V(V)O(40)].11H(2)O and 3600 Da with H(5)[PMo(10)V(V) (2)O(40)].13H(2)O). The synthesized polymers were applied as dyes for the dyeing of flax fabrics. The color intensity of flax fabrics colored with polymer solutions was evaluated by diffuse reflectance spectrophotometry via k/s measurements (+10% of fixation ratio). A new synthetic process allowed a dyeing polymer, provided upon flax coloration, better color fixation and color resistance when compared to that obtained by conventiol synthesis with laccase solely or with addition of organic mediator (1-hydroxybenzotriazole).

21751397	In situ laccase-assisted overdyeing of denim using flavonoids	A laccase-mediated system for denim overdyeing using phenolic compounds was developed. Laccase from ascomycete Myceliophthora thermophila was able to oxidize phenolic compounds such as catechol and catechin and mediate their attachment to denim surfaces. Laccase-generated polymers gave rise to new coloration states from dark brown to green-yellow and replaced dyes in the overdyeing process. Process parameters, such as enzyme dosage, incubation time and presence of mediator, were studied by considering a compromise between the highest overdyeing level and lower energy/products consumption (2 U/mL laccase; 4 h incubation in the absence of mediator). Enzyme-generated polymers were followed by UV/Vis spectrophotometry and their level of attachment to denim surfaces was evaluated by means of spectral values quantification [k/s, Kubelka-Munk relationship (k=absorption coefficient, s=scattering coefficient)]. Overdyeing of denim with phenolics, such as catechol or catechin, was successfully achieved with acceptable levels in terms of durability.

21903143	Oxidation of galactomann by laccase plus TEMPO yields an elastic gel	Chemical modifications of galactomanns are applied to improve and/or modify their solubility, rheological and functiol properties, but have limited specificity and are often difficult to control. Enzymatic reactions, catalyzed under mild process conditions, such as depolymerization, debranching and oxidation, represent a viable and eco-friendly altertive. In this study, we describe oxidation of guar galactomann primary hydroxyl groups by a fungal laccase using the stable radical TEMPO as mediator. Four fungal laccases were investigated from: Trametes versicolor, Myceliophthora thermophila, Thielavia areria, Cerre unicolor. The laccase from T. versicolor was found to efficiently oxidize TEMPO and to be free of manse side activity. Oxidation of galactomann with this enzyme plus TEMPO brought about a ten-fold increase in viscosity of a guar galactomann solution and altered its rheological profile, by converting a viscous polysaccharide solution into an elastic gel. This structural modification is presumably due to formation of inter-chain hemiacetalic bonds between newly generated carbonyl groups and free OH groups, yielding a cross-linked gel. These findings could be of practical importance, considering that polysaccharides with high viscosity, gelling and elastic properties can find interesting and novel applications as thickeners, viscosifiers and emulsion stabilizers in several industrial applications such as: persol care, oil operations, paper coating, paints, construction and mining.

We describe a case of invasive Myceliophthora thermophila infection mimicking invasive aspergillosis in a neutropenic patient with haematological maligncy. Cross-reactivity with Aspergillus galactomann assay (GM) was demonstrated by repeated positive results and confirmed by cross-reaction between the fungal isolate and the GM assay.

21241422	Optimal culture conditions for keratise production by a novel thermophilic Myceliophthora thermophila strain GZUIFR-H49-1	AIMS:   To investigate the effect of medium compositions and culture conditions on keratise production by a novel thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila (Apinis) Oorschot strain GZUIFR-H49-1. METHODS AND RESULTS:   The thermophilic strain GZUIFR-H49-1 with keratinolytic ability was characterized and identified as a strain of M. thermophila on the basis of its morphological characters and molecular alysis of ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rD sequence. Among the medium compositions tested, the soluble starch (SS), urea, sodium thiosulfate and CaCl2 were the most effective C-source, N-source, S-source and mineral ion, respectively, by employing the single-factor experiment. The urea and pH value were the significant factors (P < 0.05) for the keratise production in this experiment condition using Plackett-Burman factorial design. The conditions of keratise production were further optimized by Box-Behnken design. Consequently, there was a 6.4-fold increase (5100 U l-1) in the keratise activity than the initial value (800 U l-1) by this optimal process. CONCLUSIONS:   This study indicated that the optimization design proved a useful and powerful tool for the development of optimal medium compositions and culture conditions. Myceliophthora thermophila strain GZUIFR-H49-1 was a promising fungus strain for keratise production.

25919617	Chemical modification and immobilisation of laccase from Trametes hirsuta and from Myceliophthora thermophila	Laccase from two different source organisms, Myceliophthora thermophila and Trametes hirsuta, were subjected to chemical modification in solution by (i) two bifunctiol reagents, ethylene-glycol-N-hydroxy succinimide (EGNHS) and glutaraldehyde and (ii) by the monofunctiol citraconic anhydride. The untreated and chemically modified forms of both enzymes were then immobilised onto three different types of mesoporous silicate (MPS) particle (MCM, CNS and SBA-15). Thermal stabilities of tive, modified-soluble and immobilised laccases were then evaluated. Although the two laccases have similar lysine contents, those of M. thermophila are clearly more ameble to chemical modification. Treatment of the M. thermophila enzyme with EGNHS led to a 8.7-fold increase in thermal stability over the free soluble enzyme while glutaraldehyde gave a 5.7-fold increase. Increased activity of M. thermophila laccase occurred only with citraconic anhydride modification (a 3-fold increase), while the glutaraldehyde modification margilly increased the activity of the T. hirsuta enzyme (by 1.2-fold). Upon immobilisation onto MPS, the greatest increase in stability was for the glutaraldehyde-treated M. thermophila preparation on SBA-15 (24-fold over the soluble enzyme). Chemical modification of laccase from T. hirsuta with both glutaraldehyde and EGNHS gave only a 2-fold increase in stability, increasing >4-fold upon immobilisation onto SBA-15 and MCM-41/98.

The hydrolysis rate was higher at 60 degrees C as compared to 26 degrees Celsius. Among all the organic acids tested, citrate was more effective in enhancing solubilization of insoluble phytate salts by phytase than others. The dry weight and inorganic phosphate contents of the wheat plants were high when supplemented with phytase or fungal spores. The plants provided with 5 mg phytate per plant exhibited enhanced growth and inorganic phosphate. With increase in the dosage of phytase, there was increase in growth and inorganic phosphate of plants, the highest being at 20 U per plant. The compost made employing the combined tive microflora of the wheat straw and S. thermophile promoted growth of the plants. The plant-growth-promoting effect was also higher with the compost made using S. thermophile than that from only the tive microflora.

The putative GE gene ge2 from the genomic D was successfully cloned in frame with the sequence for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor secretion sigl under the transcriptiol control of the alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter and integrated in P. pastoris X-33 to confirm that the encoded enzyme StGE2 exhibits esterase activity. The enzyme was active on substrates containing glucuronic acid methyl ester, showing optimal activity at pH 7.0 and 55 degrees C. The esterase displayed broad pH range stability between 4-10 and temperature stability up to 50 degrees C, rendering StGE2 a strong candidate for future biotechnological applications that require robust biocatalysts. ClustalW alignment of StGE2 with characterized GEs and selected homologous sequences, members of CE-15 family, revealed a novel consensus sequence G-C-S-R-X-G that features the characteristic serine residue involved in the generally conserved catalytic mechanism of the esterase family. The putative serine has been mutated, and the corresponding enzyme has been expressed in P. pastoris to prove that the candidate nucleophilic residue is responsible for catalyzing the enzymatic reaction.

They were used for the 'one pot' synthesis of azole derivatives from 1-aminobenzotriazole together with the p-dihydroxylated laccase substrates 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid methyl ester and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid ethyl ester. The reactions yielded heteromolecular dimers (in yields of up to 34%). Methanol was used as the co-solvent to determine the influence of solvent concentration on the course of reaction. The resulting products were isolated, structurally characterized and tested for their antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities. The products showed low antimicrobial activity and low cytotoxicity compared with commercial available standard compounds but these variables exceeded those of the initial reactants used for the synthesis. In addition to the synthesis of heteromolecular dimers, oligomers were formed and structurally characterized by LC/MS (liquid chromatography/MS).

20176477	Polymerization of lignosulfotes by the laccase-HBT (1-hydroxybenzotriazole) system improves dispersibility	The ability of laccases from Trametes villosa (TvL), Myceliophthora thermophila (MtL), Trametes hirsuta (ThL) and Bacillus subtilis (BsL) to improve the dispersion properties of calcium lignosulfotes 398 in the presence of HBT as a mediator was investigated. Size exclusion chromatography showed an extensive increase in molecular weight of the samples incubated with TvL and ThL by 107% and 572% from 28400 Da after 17h of incubation, respectively. Interestingly, FTIR spectroscopy, (13)C NMR and Py-GC/MS alysis of the treated samples suggested no substantial changes in the aromatic sigl of the lignosulfotes, a good indication of the ability of TvL/ThL-HBT systems to limit their effect on functiol groups without degrading the lignin backbone. Further, the enzymatic treatments led to a general increase in the dispersion properties, indeed a welcome development for its application in polymer blends.

19095833	Left ventricular assist device outflow cannula obstruction by the rare environmental fungus Myceliophthora thermophila	Left ventricular assist devices are used to provide mechanical circulatory support during end-stage heart failure either as a destition therapy or as a bridge to heart transplantation. Perioperative transesophageal echocardiography is becoming an invaluable tool to investigate device function during implantation and in case of mechanical malfunction. Most malfunctions are due to inflow graft occlusion, or device malfunction, while outflow graft dysfunction is rare. Here, we present a case of severe outflow conduit obstruction by a rare environmental fungus, Myceliophthora thermophila. After replacement of the infected device and intensive antifungal treatment, heart transplantation was performed 2 yr later.

19482085	An unusual ring--a opening and other reactions in steroid transformation by the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila	A series of steroids (progesterone, testosterone acetate, 17beta-acetoxy-5 alpha-androstan-3-one, testosterone and androst-4-en-3,17-dione) have been incubated with the thermophilic ascomycete Myceliophthora thermophila CBS 117.65. A wide range of biocatalytic activity was observed with modification at all four rings of the steroid nucleus and the C-17beta side-chain. This is the first thermophilic fungus to demonstrate the side-chain cleavage of progesterone. A unique fungal transformation was observed following incubation of the saturated steroid 17beta-acetoxy-5 alpha-androstan-3-one resulting in 4-hydroxy-3,4-seco-pregn-20-one-3-oic acid which was the product generated following the opening of an A-homo steroid, presumably by lactonohydrolase activity. Hydroxylation predomited at axial protons of the steroids containing 3-one-4-ene ring-functiolity. This organism also demonstrated reversible acetylation and oxidation of the 17beta-alcohol of testosterone. All steroidal metabolites were isolated by column chromatography and were identified by (1)H, (13)C NMR, DEPT alysis and other spectroscopic data. The range of steroidal modification achieved with this fungus indicates that these organisms may be a rich source of novel steroid biocatalysis which deserve greater investigation in the future.

19646732	Oxidation of the erythro and threo forms of the phenolic lignin model compound 1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-1,3-propanediol by laccases and model oxidants	Mixtures of equal amounts of the erythro and threo forms of the phenolic arylglycerol beta-aryl ether 1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-1,3-propanediol were oxidized (i) with laccases from Trametes versicolor, Agaricus bisporus, Myceliophthora thermophila and Rhus vernicifera, (ii) with laccase-mediator systems consisting of T. versicolor laccase and ABTS or HBT, and (iii) with various model oxidants including cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN), lignin peroxidase, Fenton's reagent, and lead(IV) tetraacetate (LTA). All the laccases exhibited a similar preferential degradation of the threo form. The mediator ABTS counteracted the threo preference of laccase, but the mediator HBT did not affect it. The outer-sphere model oxidants CAN and lignin peroxidase showed a preferential degradation of the threo form. LTA and Fenton's reagent did not exhibit any stereo-preference. The results suggest that laccases of different origin, primary structure, and redox potential behave as typical outer-sphere oxidants in their interaction with the diastereomers of the arylglycerol beta-aryl ether.

19054669	Characterization of a HAP-phytase from a thermophilic mould Sporotrichum thermophile	The phytase of Sporotrichum thermophile was purified to homogeneity using acetone precipitation followed by ion-exchange and gel-filtration column chromatography. The purified phytase is a homopentamer with a molecular mass of approximately 456kDa and pI of 4.9. It is a glycoprotein with about 14% carbohydrate, and optimally active at pH 5.0 and 60 degrees C with a T(1/2) of 16h at 60 degrees C and 1.5h at 80 degrees C. The activation energy of the enzyme reaction is 48.6KJmol(-1) with a temperature quotient of 1.66, and it displayed broad substrate specificity. Mg(2+) exhibited a slight stimulatory effect on the enzyme activity, while it was markedly inhibited by 2,3-butanedione suggesting a possible role of arginine in its catalysis. The chaotropic agents such as guanidinium hydrochloride, urea and potassium iodide strongly inhibited phytase activity. Inorganic phosphate inhibited enzyme activity beyond 3mM. The maximum hydrolysis rate (V(max)) and apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (K(m)) for sodium phytate were 83nmolmg(-1)s(-1) and 0.156mM, respectively. The catalytic turnover number (K(cat)) and catalytic efficiency (K(cat)/K(m)) of phytase were 37.8s(-1) and 2.4x10(5)M(-1)s(-1), respectively. Based on the N-termil and MALDI-LC-MS/MS identified amino acid sequences of the peptides, the enzyme did not show a significant homology with the known phytases.

19459957	Purification, characterization and mass spectrometric sequencing of a thermophilic glucuronoyl esterase from Sporotrichum thermophile	The cellulolytic system of the thermophilic fungus Sporotrichum thermophile contains a recently discovered esterase that may hydrolyze the ester linkage between the 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid of glucuronoxylan and lignin alcohols. The glucuronoyl esterase med StGE1 was purified to homogeneity with a molecular mass of M(r) 58 kDa and pI 6.7. The enzyme activity was optimal at pH 6.0 and 60 degrees C. The esterase displayed a rrow pH range stability at pH 8.0 and retained 50% of its activity after 430 and 286 min at 50 and 55 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme was active on substrates containing glucuronic acid methyl ester, showing a lower catalytic efficiency on 4-nitrophenyl 2-O-(methyl-4-O-methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranosylurote)-beta-D-xylopyranoside than its mesophilic counterparts reported in the literature, which is typical of thermophilic enzymes. StGE1 was proved to be a modular enzyme containing a noncatalytic carbohydrate-binding module. LC-MS/MS alysis provided peptide mass and sequence information that facilitated the identification and classification of StGE1 as a family 15 glucuronoyl esterase that showed the highest homology with the hypothetical glucuronoyl esterase CHGG_10774 of Chaetomium globosum CBS 148.51. This work represents the first example of the purification and identification of a thermophilic glucuronoyl esterase from S. thermophile.

18695937	Laccase-catalyzed carbon-nitrogen bond formation: coupling and derivatization of unprotected L-phenylalanine with different para-hydroquinones	Unprotected L-phenylalanine was derivatized by an innovative enzymatic method by means of laccases from Pycnoporus cinbarinus and Myceliophthora thermophila. During the incubation of L-phenylalanine with para-hydroquinones using laccase as biocatalyst, one or two main products were formed. Dependent on the substitution grade of the hydroquinones mono- and diamited products were detected. Differences of the used laccases are discussed. The described reactions are of interest for the derivatization of amino acids and a synthesis of pharmacological-active amino acid structures in the field of white biotechnology.

19788410	Synthesis of model morpholine derivatives with biological activities by laccase-catalysed reactions	The efficient enzyme-catalysed reaction of morpholines as model structures for bioactive compounds with para-dihydroxylated aromatic systems was carried out using the oxidoreductase laccase and atmospheric oxygen to produce eight novel morpholine-substituted aromatics. The laccase of Myceliophthora thermophila was used for cross-linking morpholines containing primary or secondary amino groups with para-dihydroxylated laccase substrates. We demonstrate that not only primary amino groups, but also secondary amino groups, are able to couple with para-dihydroxylated aromatic systems in laccase-catalysed reactions. The resulting model products (yields up to 80%) were isolated, structurally characterized and tested for their antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities. Four of the eight products showed low to moderate growth inhibition against several Gram-positive and -negative bacterial strains and against the yeasts Candida maltosa and Candida albicans. The antibacterial and antifungal activities were determined by an agar disc diffusion test and a modified method according to the EUCAST discussion document E.Dis 7.1 [Rodriguez-Tudela et al. (2003) Clin. Microbiol. Infect. 9, i-viii] for the evaluation of MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration).

19075602	Combitorial saturation mutagenesis of the Myceliophthora thermophila laccase T2 mutant: the connection between the C-termil plug and the conserved (509)VSG(511) tripeptide	A mutant laccase from the Ascomycete Myceliophthora thermophila has been submitted to iterative cycles of combitorial saturation mutagenesis through in vivo overlap extension in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Over 180,000 clones were explored, among which the S510G mutant revealed a direct interaction between the conserved (509)VSG(511) tripeptide, located in the neighborhood of the T1 site, and the C-termil plug. The K(m)(O)(2) value of the mutant increased 1.5-fold, and the electron transfer pathway between the reducing substrate and the T1 copper ion was altered, improving the catalytic efficiency towards non-phenolic and phenolic substrates by about 3- and 8-fold. Although the geometry at the T1 site was perturbed by the mutation, paradoxically the laccase redox potential was not significantly altered. Together, the results obtained in this study suggest that the (509)VSG(511) tripeptide may play a hitherto unrecognized role in regulating the traffic of oxygen through the C-termil plug, the latter blocking access to the T2/T3 copper cluster in the tive enzyme.

17932916	Altering the laccase functiolity by in vivo assembly of mutant libraries with different mutatiol spectra	The generation of diversity for directed protein evolution experiments shows an important bottleneck in the in vitro random mutagenesis protocols. Most of them are biased towards specific changes that eventually confer a predicted and conservative mutatiol spectrum, limiting the exploration of the vast protein space. The current work describes a simple methodology to in vivo recombine mutant libraries with different nucleotide bias created by in vitro methods. This in vivo assembly was based on the accurate physiology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which as host, provided its high homologous recombition frequency to shuffle the libraries in a nonmutagenic way. The fungal thermophilic laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila expressed in S. cerevisiae was submitted to this protocol under the selective pressure of high concentrations of organic solvents. Mutant 2E9 with approximately 3-fold better kinetics than parent type showed two consecutive amino acid changes (G614D -GGC/GAC- and E615K -GAG/AAG-) because of the in vivo shuffling of the mutant libraries. Both mutations are located in the C-termil tail that is specifically processed at the Golgi during the maturation of the protein by the Kex2 protease. Notoriously, the oxygen consumption at the T2/T3 trinuclear copper cluster was altered and the catalytic copper at the T1 site was perturbed showing differences in its redox potential and geometry. The change in the isoelectric point of C-termil extension upon mutations seems to affect the folding of the protein at the posttranslatiol processing steps providing new insights in the significance of the C-termil tail for the functiolity of the ascomycete laccases.

18292878	An assessment of the relative contributions of redox and steric issues to laccase specificity towards putative substrates	Laccases catalyze the one-electron oxidation of a broad range of substrates coupled to the 4 electron reduction of O2 to H2O. Phenols are typical substrates, because their redox potentials (ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 V vs. NHE) are low enough to allow electron abstraction by the T1 Cu(II) that, although a relatively modest oxidant (in the 0.4-0.8 V range), is the electron-acceptor in laccases. The present study comparatively investigated the oxidation performances of Trametes villosa and Myceliophthora thermophila laccases, two enzymes markedly differing in redox potential (0.79 and 0.46 V). The oxidation efficiency and kinetic constants of laccase-catalyzed conversion of putative substrates were determined. Hammett plots related to the oxidation of substituted phenols by the two laccases, in combition with the kinetic isotope effect determition, confirmed a rate-determining electron transfer from the substrate to the enzyme. The efficiency of oxidation was found to increase with the decrease in redox potential of the substrates, and the Marcus reorganisation energy for electron transfer to the T1 copper site was determined. Steric hindrance to substrate docking was inferred because some of the phenols and anilines investigated, despite possessing a redox potential compatible with one-electron abstraction, were scarcely oxidised. A threshold value of steric hindrance of the substrate, allowed for fitting into the active site of T. villosa laccase, was extrapolated from structural information provided by X-ray alysis of T. versicolor lac3B, sharing an identity of 99% at the protein level, thus ebling us to assess the relative contribution of steric and redox properties of a substrate in determining its susceptibility to laccase oxidation. The inferred structural threshold is compatible with the distance between two phenylalanine residues that mark the entrance to the active site. Interaction of the substrate with other residues of the active site is commented on.

17350826	Improved phytase production by a thermophilic mould Sporotrichum thermophile in submerged fermentation due to statistical optimization	Culture variables affecting phytase production by a thermophilic mould Sporotrichum thermophile in submerged fermentation were optimized. Soluble starch, peptone, Tween-80 and sodium phytate were identified by Plackett-Burman design as the most significant factors to affect phytase production. The 2(4) full factorial central composite design of response surface methodology was applied for optimizing the concentrations of the significant variables and to delineate their interactions. Starch, Tween-80, peptone and sodium phytate at 0.4%, 1.0%, 0.3% and 0.3% supported maximum enzyme titres, respectively. An overall 3.73-fold improvement in phytase production was achieved due to optimization. When sodium phytate was substituted with wheat bran (3%), the phytase titre in the former was comparable with that in the latter.

19120634	Phytase production by Sporotrichum thermophile in a cost-effective cane molasses medium in submerged fermentation and its application in bread	AIMS: Phytase production by Sporotrichum thermophile in a cost-effective cane molasses medium in submerged fermentation and its application in bread. METHODS AND RESULTS: The production of phytase by a thermophilic mould S. thermophile was investigated using free and immobilized conidiospores in cane molasses medium in shake flasks, and stirred tank and air-lift fermenters. Among surfactants tested, Tweens (Tween-20, 40 and 80) and sodium oleate increased phytase accumulation, whereas SDS and Triton X-100 inhibited the enzyme production. The mould produced phytase optimally at a(w) 0.95, and it declined sharply below this a(w) value. The enzyme production was comparable in air-lift and stirred tank reactors with a marked reduction in fermentation time. Among the matrices tried, Ca-algite was the best for conidiospore immobilization, and fungus secreted sustained levels of enzyme titres over five cycles. The phytic acid in the dough was efficiently hydrolysed by the enzyme accompanied by the liberation of soluble phosphate in the bread. CONCLUSIONS: The phytase production by S. thermophile was enhanced in the presence of Tween-80 in cane molasses medium. A peak in enzyme production was attained in 48 h in the fermenter when compared with that of 96 h in shake flasks. Ca-algite immobilized conidiospores germited to produce fungal growth that secreted sustained levels of phytase over five cycles. The bread made with phytase contained reduced level of phytic acid and a high-soluble phosphate. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The phytase accumulation by S. thermophile was increased by the surfactants. The sustaibility of enzyme production in stirred tank and air-lift fermenters suggested the possibility for scaling up of phytase. The bread made with phytase contained low level of antinutrient, i.e. phytic acid.		Journal of applied microbiology	Department of Microbiology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, India.

17681787	Phytase production by a thermophilic mould Sporotrichum thermophile in solid state fermentation and its potential applications	Phytase production by a thermophilic mould Sporotrichum thermophile Apinis was investigated in solid state fermentation (SSF) using sesame oil cake as the substrate. Scanning electron microscopy of the fermented sesame oil cake revealed a dense growth of the mould with abundant conidia. Glucose, ammonium sulphate and incubation period were identified as the most significant factors by Plackett-Burman design. The optimum values of the critical components determined by central composite design of response surface methodology for the maximum phytase production were glucose 3%, ammonium sulphate 0.5% and incubation period 120 h. An overall 2.6-fold improvement in phytase production was achieved due to optimization. Highest enzyme production (348.76 U/g DMR) was attained at a substrate bed depth of 1.5 cm in emel coated metallic trays. The enzyme liberated inorganic phosphate from wheat flour and soymilk with concomitant dephytinization and liberation of soluble inorganic phosphate.

18668239	Laccase-induced C-N coupling of substituted p-hydroquinones with p-aminobenzoic acid in comparison with known chemical routes	Fungal laccases (benzenediol:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.10.3.2) from Pycnoporus cinbarinus and Myceliophthora thermophila were used as biocatalysts for enzymatic reaction of halogen-, alkyl-, alkoxy-, and carbonyl-substituted p-hydroquinones (laccase substrates) with p-aminobenzoic acid (no laccase substrate). During this reaction, the laccase substrate was oxidized to the corresponding quinones, which react with p-aminobenzoic acid by amition of the laccase substrate. The different substitutions at the hydroquinone substrates were used to prove whether the substituents influence the position of amition and product yields. The cross-coupling of methoxy-p-hydroquinone (alkoxylated) and 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyd (carbonyl-substituted) with p-aminobenzoic acid resulted in the formation of one monoamited product (yield alkoxylated 52%). If monohalogen- or monoalkyl-substituted p-hydroquinones were used as laccase substrates, two monoamited products (constitution isomers) were formed. The simultaneous formation of two different monoamited products from the same hydroquinone substrate is the first report for laccase-mediated synthesis of amited constitution isomers. Depending from the type of substituent of the hydroquinone, the positions of the two monoamitions are different. While the amition at the monoalkylated hydroquinone occurs at the 5- and 6-positions (yield 38%), the amition at monohalogeted hydroquinones was detectable at the 3- and 5-positions (yield 53%). The same product pattern could be achieved if instead of the biocatalyst laccase the chemical catalyst sodium iodate was used as the oxidant. However, the yields were partially much lower (0-45% of the yields with laccase).

17503417	Cytotoxic polyketides containing tetramic acid moieties isolated from the fungus Myceliophthora Thermophila: elucidation of the relationship between cytotoxicity and stereoconfiguration	Five new polyketides that contain tetramic acids, myceliothermophins A-E, were isolated from the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila. Two sets of 5-alkyl-5-hydroxyl (or 5-methoxyl)-1H-pyrrol-2(5H)-one diastereomers, myceliothermophins A/B and C/D, were separated as pure compounds by using silica-gel column chromatography and recycling reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The relative configurations of the chiral centers in 5-alkyl-5-hydroxyl (or 5-methoxyl)-1H-pyrrol-2(5H)-one moieties were deduced from NOESY correlations. In the cytotoxic assay, the 5-(2-methylpropyldiene)-1H-pyrrol-2(5H)-one alogue (myceliothermophin E) exhibited inhibition against four cancer cell lines. In addition, the significant inhibitory effect of myceliothermophins A and C and the ictivity of myceliothermophins B and D revealed the importance of the relative configurations of 5-alkyl-5-hydroxyl (or 5-methoxyl)-1H-pyrrol-2(5H)-one moieties on their cytotoxicity potency against cancer cells.

19071650	Antioxidants determition with laccase	The spectrophotometric method of antioxidants determition using recombint laccase Polyporus pinsitus (rPpL) and Myceliophthora thermophila (rMtL) was developed. The method includes simultaneous oxidation of the antioxidant and high reactive laccase substrate producing chromophoric radical cation. As laccase substrates ABTS and other high reactive phenoxazine derivatives: 2-phenoxazin-10-yl-ethanol (PET), 3-phenoxazin-10-yl-propane-1-sulfonic acid (PPSA) and 3-phenoxazin-10-yl-propionic acid (PPA) were used. The kinetic data were alysed using a scheme of simultaneous oxidation of the antioxidant and the substrate. In a range of (0.9-7.3)x10(-6)M of Trolox the measurings recovered 91 and 99% of the antioxidant if ABTS and both laccases were used. The recovery varied between 82 and 124% if phenoxazine derivatives were used. The antioxidant activity determined in rich with antioxidants food samples, i.e. date-palm, black raisin, golden raisin, skin of red grape, dice of red grape, fitted the literature data.

All products inhibited the growth of several Gram positive bacterial strains in the agar diffusion assay, among them methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. The products protected mice against an infection with Staphylococcus aureus lethal to the control animals. Cytotoxicity and acute toxicity of the new compounds were negligible. The results show the usefulness of laccase for the synthesis of potential new antibiotics. The biological activity of the new compounds stimulates intensified pharmacological tests.

16961922	Severe osteomyelitis caused by Myceliophthora thermophila after a pitchfork injury	BACKGROUND: Traumatic injuries occurring in agricultural settings are often associated with infections caused by unusual organisms. Such agents may be difficult to isolate, identify, and treat effectively. CASE REPORT: A 4-year-old boy developed an extensive infection of his knee and distal femur following a barnyard pitchfork injury. Ultimately the primary infecting agent was determined to be Myceliophthora thermophila, a thermophilic melanized hyphomycete, rarely associated with human infection, found in animal excreta. Because of resistance to standard antifungal agents including amphotericin B and caspofungin, therapy was instituted with a prolonged course of terbifine and voricozole. Voricozole blood levels demonstrated that the patient required a drug dosage (13.4 mg/kg) several fold greater than that recommended for adults in order to attain therapeutic blood levels. CONCLUSION: Unusual pathogens should be sought following traumatic farm injuries.

17168677	Combitorial saturation mutagenesis by in vivo overlap extension for the engineering of fungal laccases	Combitorial saturation mutagenesis -CSM- is a valuable tool for improving enzymatic properties from hot-spot residues discovered by directed enzyme evolution or performing semi-ratiol studies. CSM coupled to a reliable high-throughput screening assay -coefficient of variance below 10%- has been used to enhance turnover rates in the fungal laccase variant T2 from Myceliophthora thermophila. The influence of the highly conserved pentapeptide 509-513 on the redox potential of blue-copper containing enzymes is well described. We focused combitorial saturation mutagenesis in residues Ser510 and Leu513. Libraries were constructed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by in vivo overlap extension -IVOE- of the PCR products. This methodology provides a simple manner to build CSM libraries avoiding extra PCR reactions, by-products formation and in vitro ligation steps. After exploring more than 1,700 clones, mutant (7E1) with approximately 3-fold higher kinetics than parent type was found. 7E1 showed one synonymous mutation (L513L, CGT/TTG) and one beneficial mutation S510G (TCG/GGG) that can not be achieved by conventiol error-prone PCR techniques. Mutation S510G seems to affect the C-termil plug, which modulates the transit of water and oxygen to the trinuclear copper cluster.

16848420	Thermostability of tive and pegylated Myceliophthora thermophila laccase in aqueous and mixed solvents	A commercial preparation of laccase (EC 1.10.3.2), cloned from Myceliophthora thermophila and expressed in Aspergillus oryzae (MtL), was purified and modified by conjugation with poly(ethylene glycol) (M(r) = 5000) and is labeled PEG-MtL. tive enzyme was found to have a molecular mass of 80 kDa, as determined by gel filtration, and 110 kDa, by SDS-PAGE. The oxidative dimerization of 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP) to produce the corresponding dibenzoquinone was catalyzed by MtL in a manner comparable to that for a diffusion-controlled reaction (k(cat)/K(M) approximately = 10(8) M(-)(1) s(-)(1) and E(a) approximately = 18 kJ M(-)(1)). PEG-MtL was found, by TNBS titration, to have blocked 54% of lysine groups; its hydrodymic and charge properties were different from those of MtL. Catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(M)) of PEG-MtL was similar to that of MtL with DMP as substrate; however, k(cat)/K(M) was 2-fold reduced for the reaction in which 2',2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) is oxidized to form a radical cation. E(a) values were similar in both enzyme preparations when assayed in buffered solutions. Far-UV CD spectra were similar for MtL and PEG-MtL and consistent with a protein rich in beta-sheet structure with negligible content of alpha-helices. A blue shift of near-UV CD spectrum for PEG-MtL as compared to MtL was consistent with the decreased polarity of the tyrosyl side chains upon PEG conjugation. Also the blue band of the copper active site was shifted from lambda approximately 610 nm (MtL) to lambda approximately 575 nm (PEG-MtL). Scanning microcalorimetry showed small deturation enthalpies (6.3 and 7.5 J g(-)(1) for MtL and PEG-MtL, respectively), indicating the high stability of the beta-sheet folding pattern of laccases. However, PEG-MtL proved to be more stable, its half-deturation temperature being 2 degrees C higher than that of MtL. In 30% alcohol, pegylated laccase showed slower enzyme-activity decay rates than the unmodified enzyme; this behavior was caused by a decrease in the activation entropy of the deturation reaction. Results can be explained by entropic stabilization by PEG conjugation because of the restricted motion of some surface amino acid side chains, which results in a more stable active site.

16882141	A marked enhancement in phytase production by a thermophilic mould Sporotrichum thermophile using statistical designs in a cost-effective cane molasses medium	AIMS: Statistical optimization of phytase production by a thermophilic mould Sporotrichum thermophile in a cost-effective cane molasses medium. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sporotrichum thermophile secreted phytase in cane molasses medium at 45 degrees C and 250 rev min(-1) after 5 days. The important factors identified by Plackett-Burman design (magnesium sulfate, Tween 80, ammonium sulfate and incubation period) were further optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). An overall 107% improvement in phytase production was achieved due to optimization. Supplementation of the medium with inorganic phosphate repressed the enzyme synthesis. When inorganic phosphate was reduced from the cane molasses medium by treatment with calcium chloride, the enzyme production increased. The phytase activity was not affected by the enzyme treatment with trypsin and pepsin. CONCLUSIONS: A twofold increase in phytase production was achieved due to optimization using statistical designs in a cost-effective cane molasses medium. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Phytase production was doubled due to optimization. The enzyme, being resistant to trypsin and pepsin, thermostable and acid stable, can find application in animal feed industry for improving nutritiol status of the feed and combating environmental phosphorus pollution.

16720904	Phytase production by thermophilic mold Sporotrichum thermophile in solid-state fermentation and its application in dephytinization of sesame oil cake	The phytase production by Sporotrichum thermophile TLR50 was recorded on all the commonly used animal feed ingredients tested to varying degrees in solid-state fermentation. Enzyme production increased to 180 U/g of dry moldy residue (DMR) in sesame oil cake at 120 h and 45 degrees C at the initial substrate-to-moisture ratio of 1:2.5 and aw of 0.95. Supplementation of sesame oil cake with glucose and ammonium sulfate further enhanced phytase titer (282 U/g of DMR). An overall 76% enhancement in phytase production was achieved owing to optimization. The mold secreted acid phosphatase, amylase, xylase, and lipase along with phytase. By the action of phytase, inorganic phosphate was liberated efficiently, leading to dephytinization of sesame oil cake.

16599567	Efficiency of new fungal cellulase systems in boosting enzymatic degradation of barley straw lignocellulose	This study examined the cellulytic effects on steam-pretreated barley straw of cellulose-degrading enzyme systems from the five thermophilic fungi Chaetomium thermophilum, Thielavia terrestris, Thermoascus aurantiacus, Coryscus thermophilus, and Myceliophthora thermophila and from the mesophile Penicillum funiculosum. The catalytic glucose release was compared after treatments with each of the crude enzyme systems when added to a benchmark blend of a commercial cellulase product, Celluclast, derived from Trichoderma reesei and a beta-glucosidase, Novozym 188, from Aspergillus niger. The enzymatic treatments were evaluated in an experimental design template comprising a span of pH (3.5-6.5) and temperature (35-65 degrees C) reaction combitions. The addition to Celluclast + Novozym 188 of low dosages of the crude enzyme systems, corresponding to 10 wt % of the total enzyme protein load, increased the catalytic glucose yields significantly as compared to those obtained with the benchmark Celluclast + Novozyme 188 blend. A comparison of glucose yields obtained on steam-pretreated barley straw and microcrystalline cellulose, Avicel, indicated that the yield improvements were mainly due to the presence of highly active endoglucase activity/activities in the experimental enzyme preparations. The data demonstrated the feasibility of boosting the widely studied T. reeseicellulase enzyme system with additiol enzymatic activity to achieve faster lignocellulose degradation. We conclude that this supplementation strategy appears feasible as a first step in identifying truly promising fungal enzyme sources for fast development of improved, commercially viable, enzyme preparations for lignocellulose degradation.

16103414	Screening mutant libraries of fungal laccases in the presence of organic solvents	Reliable screening methods are being demanded by biocatalysts' engineers, especially when some features such as activity or stability are targets to improve under non-tural conditions (i.e., in the presence of organic solvents). The current work describes a protocol for the design of a fungal laccase-expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae-highly active in organic cosolvents. A high-throughput screening assay based on ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) oxidation was validated. The stability of the ABTS radical cation was not significantly altered in the presence of acetonitrile, ethanol, or DMSO. With a coefficient of variance below 10% and a sensitivity limit of 15 pg laccase/microL, the assay was reproducible and sensitive. The expression system of Myceliophthora thermophila laccase variant T2 in S. cerevisiae was highly dependent on the presence of Cu2+. Copper concentration was limited up to 10 microM CuSO4 where expression levels (approximately 14-18 mg/L) were acceptable without compromising the reliability of the assay. A mutant library was created by error-prone PCR with 1.1 to 3.5 mutations per kb. After only 1 generation of directed evolution, mutant 6C9 displayed about 3.5-fold higher activities than parent type in the presence of 20% acetonitrile or 30% ethanol. The method provided here should be generally useful to improve the activity of other redox enzymes in mixtures of water/cosolvents.

16080184	Laccase-catalysed iodide oxidation in presence of methyl syringate	The kinetics of potassium triiodide (KI(3)) formation during fungal laccase action was investigated in presence of methyl syringate (MS). The recombint forms of Polyporus pinsitus (rPpL), Myceliophthora thermophila (rMtL), Coprinus cinereus (rCcL), and Rhizoctonia solani (rRsL) laccases were used. The triiodide formation rate reached 6.1, 5.5, 6.0, and 2.1 microM/min at saturated rPpL, rCcL, rRsL, and rMtL concentration, respectively, in acetate buffer solution pH 5.5 and in presence of 10 microM of MS and 1 mM of potassium iodide. The triiodide formation rate increased if pH decreased from 6.5 to 4.5. The scheme of laccase-catalysed iodide oxidation includes stadium of MS interaction with oxidized laccase with concomitant production of MS(ox). The reaction of MS(ox) with iodide produced triiodide. The turnover number of MS was 93 and 44 at pH 5.5 for rPpL and rMtL, respectively. The scheme also contained a stadium of reversible reduction of laccase active centre with the mediator explaining the different saturation rate of triiodide production. The fitting kinetic data revealed that the reversibility of the reaction increased for laccases containing lower redox potential of copper type I.

15639097	Comparison of mesophilic and thermophilic feruloyl esterases: characterization of their substrate specificity for methyl phenylalkanoates	The active sites of feruloyl esterases from mesophilic and thermophilic sources were probed using methyl esters of phenylalkanoic acids. Only 13 out of 26 substrates tested were significant substrates for all the enzymes. Lengthening or shortening the aliphatic side chain while maintaining the same aromatic substitutions completely abolished activity for both enzymes, which demonstrates the importance of the correct distance between the aromatic group and the ester bond. Maintaining the phenylpropanoate structure but altering the substitutions of the aromatic ring demonstrated that the type-A esterase from the mesophilic fungus FUSArium oxysporum (FoFaeA) showed a preference for methoxylated substrates, in contrast to the type-B esterase from the same source (FoFaeB) and the thermophilic type-B (StFaeB) and type-C (StFaeC) from Sporotrichum thermophile, which preferred hydroxylated substrates. All four esterases hydrolyzed short chain aliphatic acid (C2-C4) esters of p-nitrophenol, but not the C12 ester of laurate. All the feruloyl esterases were able to release ferulic acid from the plant cell wall material in conjunction with a xylase, but only the type-A esterase FoFaeA was effective in releasing the 5,5' form of diferulic acid. The thermophilic type-B esterase had a lower catalytic efficiency than its mesophilic counterpart, but released more ferulic acid from plant cell walls.

15760179	Nuclear amition catalyzed by fungal laccases: reaction products of p-hydroquinones and primary aromatic amines	[reaction: see text] Nuclear amition of p-hydroquinones with primary aromatic amines was catalyzed by fungal laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) from Trametes spec. and Myceliophthora thermophila. This is the first report of laccase-catalyzed synthesis of aminoquinones. Incubation of two compounds with laccase in the presence of oxygen resulted in the formation of the corresponding monoamited or diamited quinones. No hydroquinonoids were formed. Observed differences in the reaction courses for different p-hydroquinones and aromatic amines with different laccases are discussed.

15182829	Production, characterization and application of a thermostable polygalacturose of a thermophilic mould Sporotrichum thermophile Apinis	The production of polygalacturose (PGase) by Sporotrichum thermophile Apinis in stirred submerged fermentation (SmF) was high in comparison with that in static conditions. Yeast extract (0.25%) and citrus pectin (2%) at pH 7.0 and 45 degrees C supported a high enzyme production in flasks agitated at 200 rpm. An overall 1.75-fold enhancement in PGase production was achieved as a result of optimization. The enzyme was optimally active at pH 7.0 and 55 degrees C, and exhibited t(1/2) of 4 h at 65 degrees C. The Km and Vmax values of the enzyme (for pectin) were 0.416 mg ml(-1) and 0.52 micromol mg(-1)min(-1), respectively. The PGase activity was stimulated by Mn(2+) and Fe(2+), but inhibited strongly by Mg(2+), and slightly by Tween 80 and Triton X-100. Among the additives tested, beta-mercaptoethanol exerted a strong inhibitory effect, suggesting a critical role of disulphide linkages in maintaining a suitable conformation of the enzyme. An increase in the yield of ba, grape and apple juices was recorded due to the treatment of fruit pulps with the mixture of enzymes (pectise, xylases and cellulase) of S. thermophile as compared to that with only pectise. The yield of fruit juices did not increase with enhanced titre of cellulase in the enzyme mixture.

12802527	Biosynthesis of fructo-oligosaccharides by Sporotrichum thermophile during submerged batch cultivation in high sucrose media	Biosynthesis of fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) was observed during growth of the thermophilic fungus Sporotrichum thermophile on media containing high sucrose concentrations. Submerged batch cultivation with the optimum initial sucrose concentration of 250 g/l allowed the production of 12.5 g FOS/l. The FOS mixture obtained was composed of three sugars, which were isolated by size-exclusion chromatography. They were characterized by acid hydrolysis and HPLC as 1-kestose, 6-kestose and neokestose. The mechanism of osmotic adaptation of S. thermophile was investigated and sugars and amino acids were found to be the predomint compatible solutes. The fungus accumulated glutamic acid, arginine, alanine, leucine and lysine, in order to balance the outer osmotic pressure. Fatty acid alysis of the membrane lipids showed a relatively high percentage of unsaturated lipids, which is known to be associated with high membrane fluidity.

14615854	Purification and characterization of a type B feruloyl esterase (StFAE-A) from the thermophilic fungus Sporotrichum thermophile	A feruloyl esterase (StFAE-A) produced by Sporotrichum thermophile was purified to homogeneity. The purified homogeneous preparation of tive StFAE-A exhibited a molecular mass of 57.0+/-1.5 kDa, with a mass of 33+/-1 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The pI of the enzyme was estimated by cation-exchange chromatofocusing to be at pH 3.1. The enzyme activity was optimal at pH 6.0 and 55-60 degrees C. The purified esterase was stable at the pH range 5.0-7.0. The enzyme retained 70% of activity after 7 h at 50 degrees C and lost 50% of its activity after 45 min at 55 degrees C and after 12 min at 60 degrees C. Determition of k(cat)/ K(m) revealed that the enzyme hydrolyzed methyl p-coumarate 2.5- and 12-fold more efficiently than methyl caffeate and methyl ferulate, respectively. No activity on methyl sipite was detected. The enzyme was active on substrates containing ferulic acid ester linked to the C-5 and C-2 linkages of arabinofuranose and it hydrolyzed 4-nitrophenyl 5- O- trans-feruloyl-alpha- l-arabinofuranoside (NPh-5-Fe-Ara f) 2-fold more efficiently than NPh-2-Fe-Ara f. Ferulic acid (FA) was efficiently released from destarched wheat bran when the esterase was incubated together with xylase from S. thermophile (a maximum of 34% total ferulic acid released after 1 h incubation). StFAE-A by itself could release FA, but at a level almost 47-fold lower than that obtained in the presence of xylase. The potential of StFAE-A for the synthesis of various phenolic acid esters was tested using a terry water-organic mixture consisting of n-hexane, 1-butanol and water as a reaction system.

15354533	Evaluation of certain food additives and contamints	This report represents the conclusions of a Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee convened to evaluate the safety of various food additives, with a view to recommending acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) and to prepare specifications for the identity and purity of food additives. The first part of the report contains a general discussion of the principles governing the toxicological evaluation of food additives (including flavouring agents) and contamints, assessments of intake, and the establishment and revision of specifications for food additives. A summary follows of the Committee's evaluations of toxicological and intake data on various specific food additives (alpha-amylase from Bacillus lichenformis containing a genetically engineered alpha-amylase gene from B. licheniformis, antto extracts, curcumin, diacetyl and fatty acid esters of glycerol, D-tagatose, laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila expressed in Aspergillus oryzae, mixed xylase, beta-glucase enzyme preparation produced by a strain of Humicola insolens, neotame, polyvinyl alcohol, quillaia extracts and xylase from Thermomyces lanuginosus expressed in FUSArium venetum), flavouring agents, a nutritiol source of iron (ferrous glycite, processed with citric acid), a disinfectant for drinking-water (sodium dichloroisocyanurate) and contamints (cadmium and methylmercury). Annexed to the report are tables summarizing the Committee's recommendations for ADIs of the food additives, recommendations on the flavouring agents considered, and tolerable intakes of the contamints considered, changes in the status of specifications and further information requested or desired.

12817956	Spectroscopic characterization of the Leu513His variant of fungal laccase: effect of increased axial ligand interaction on the geometric and electronic structure of the type 1 Cu site	A variety of spectroscopic techniques, combined with density functiol calculations, are used to describe the electronic structure of the Leu513His variant of the type 1 Cu site in Myceliophthora thermophila laccase. This mutation changes the type 1 Cu from a blue to a green site. Electron paramagnetic resonce (EPR), optical absorption, circular dichroism, and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopies reveal that, relative to the trigol plar blue type 1 Cu site in wild-type fungal laccase, the covalency and the ligand field strength at the Leu513His green type 1 Cu center decrease. Additiolly, there is a significant reorientation of the d(x)()()2(-)(y)()()2( )singly occupied MO, such that the overlap with the Cys sulfur valence orbital changes from pi to sigma. A density functiol study in which interl coordites are systematically altered reveals that these changes are due to the increased strength of the axial ligand (none to His), leading to a tetragol distortion and elongation of the equatorial Cu-ligand bonds. These calculations provide insight into the experimental differences in the EPR parameters, charge-transfer absorption spectrum, and ligand-field MCD spectrum between the axial-His variant and blue Cu centers (plastocyanin and the type 1 site in fungal laccase). There are also significant differences between the green site in the Leu513His variant and other turally occurring, green type 1 Cu sites such as in nitrite reductase, which have short axial Cu-S(Met) bonds. The large difference in EPR parameters between these green type 1 sites derives from a change in ligand field excitation energies observed by MCD, which reflects a decrease in ligand field strength. This is associated with different steric interactions of a His vs an axial Met ligand in a tetragolly distorted type 1 site. Changes in the electronic structure of the Cu site correlate with the difference in reactivity of the green His variant relative to blue wild-type fungal laccase.

12571021	Functiol expression of a fungal laccase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by directed evolution	Laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila (MtL) was expressed in functiol form in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Directed evolution improved expression eightfold to the highest yet reported for a laccase in yeast (18 mg/liter). Together with a 22-fold increase in k(cat), the total activity was enhanced 170-fold. Specific activities of MtL mutants toward 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) and syringaldazine indicate that substrate specificity was not changed by the introduced mutations. The most effective mutation (10-fold increase in total activity) introduced a Kex2 protease recognition site at the C-termil processing site of the protein, adjusting the protein sequence to the different protease specificities of the heterologous host. The C terminus is shown to be important for laccase activity, since removing it by a truncation of the gene reduces activity sixfold. Mutations accumulated during nine generations of evolution for higher activity decreased enzyme stability. Screening for improved stability in one generation produced a mutant more stable than the heterologous wild type and retaining the improved activity. The molecular mass of MtL expressed in S. cerevisiae is 30% higher than that of the same enzyme expressed in M. thermophila (110 kDa versus 85 kDa). Hyperglycosylation, corresponding to a 120-monomer glycan on one N-glycosylation site, is responsible for this increase. This S. cerevisiae expression system makes MtL available for functiol tailoring by directed evolution.

12485779	Amperometric biosensors based on recombint laccases for phenols determition	Graphite (GE) or printed graphite electrode (PGE) based biosensors containing recombint fungal laccase Polyporus pinsitus (rPpL), and Myceliophthora thermophila (rMtL) were developed. The enzymes were immobilized using bovine serum albumin and glutaraldehyde. At pH 5.5 and -0.1 V, the calibration graphs of GE based biosensors were hyperbolic if pyrocatechol was used. The concentration of substrate that results in 50% of steady-state response (EC(50)) was 0.7 mM and sensitivity (S) was 3.8 mA/M. The sensitivity increased up to 4 A/M if larger amount of rPpL was used. The sensitivity of biosensors changed little during 9 days of exploitation, but decreased at longer time. The PGE based biosensors were mounted into the flow-through cell and calibrated under kinetic regime. EC(50) of the biosensors containing rPpL varied from 0.6 to 4.0 mM and sensitivity varied from 0.11 to 1.9 mA/M. The response of biosensor containing thermostable laccase rMtL was less, but response saturated at larger pyrocatechol concentration. The sensitivity changed little during 6 days. Both type of biosensors responded also to 1-phthol, o-phenylenediamine, guaiacol, o-anizidine, benzidine. The experiments demonstrate recombint laccases application to biosensor engineering and their use to phenol and related compound determition under steady-state and flow-through regimes.

12932372	Biochemical and catalytic properties of an endoxylase purified from the culture filtrate of Sporotrichum thermophile	An endo-beta-1,4-xylase (1,4-beta-D-xylan xylanoxydrolase, EC 3.2.1.8) present in culture filtrates of Sporotrichum thermophile ATCC 34628 was purified to homogeneity by Q-Sepharose and Sephacryl S-200 column chromatographies. The enzyme has a molecular mass of 25,000 Da, an isoelectric point of 6.7, and is optimally active at pH 5 and at 70 degrees C. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) alysis showed that endo-xylase liberates mainly xylose (Xyl) and xylobiose (Xyl2) from beechwood 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronoxylan, O-acetyl-4-O-methylglucuronoxylan and rhodymen (a beta-(1-->4)-beta(1-->3)-xylan). Also, the enzyme releases an acidic xylo-oligosaccharide from 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronoxylan, and an isomeric xylotetraose and an isomeric xylopentaose from rhodymen. Alysis of reaction mixtures by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed that the enzyme cleaves preferentially the interl glycosidic bonds of xylooligosaccharides, [1-3H]-xylooligosaccharides and xylan. The enzyme also hydrolyses the 4-methylumbelliferyl glycosides of beta-xylobiose and beta-xylotriose at the second glycosidic bond adjacent to the aglycon. The endoxylase is not active on pNPX and pNPC. The enzyme mediates a decrease in the viscosity of xylan associated with a release of only small amounts of reducing sugar. The enzyme is irreversibly inhibited by series of omega-epoxyalkyl glycosides of D-xylopyranose. The results suggest that the endoxylase from S. thermophile has catalytic properties similar to the enzymes belonging to family 11.

12668312	Purification and characterization of a feruloyl esterase from FUSArium oxysporum catalyzing esterification of phenolic acids in terry water-organic solvent mixtures	An extracellular feruloyl esterase (FAE-II) from the culture filtrates of FUSArium oxysporum F3 was purified to homogeneity by SP-Sepharose, t-butyl-HIC and Sephacryl S-200 column chromatography. The protein corresponded to molecular mass and pI values of 27 kDa and 9.9, respectively. The enzyme was optimally active at pH 7 and 45 degrees C. The purified esterase was fully stable at pH 7.0-9.0 and temperature up to 45 degrees C after 1 h incubation. Determition of k(cat)/K(m) revealed that the enzyme hydrolysed methyl sipite 6, 21 and 40 times more efficiently than methyl ferulate, methyl coumarate and methyl caffeate, respectively. The enzyme was active on substrates containing ferulic acid ester linked to the C-5 but ictive to the C-2 positions of arabinofuranose such as 4-nitrophenyl 5-O-trans-feruloyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside and 4-nitrophenyl 2-O-trans-feruloyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside. In the presence of Sporotrichum thermophile xylase, there was a significant release of ferulic acid from destarched wheat bran by FAE-II, indicating a synergistic interaction between FAE-II and S. thermophile xylase. FAE-II by itself could release only little ferulic acid from destarched wheat bran.

12568925	Antimicrobial activity of acidic xylo-oligosaccharides produced by family 10 and 11 endoxylases	Acidic oligosaccharides were obtained from birchwood xylan by treatment with a Thermoascus aurantiacus family 10 and a Sporotrichum thermophile family 11 endoxylases. The main difference between the products liberated by xylases of family 10 and 11 concerned the length of the products containing 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid. The xylase from T. aurantiacus liberate from glucuronoxylan an aldotetrauronic acid as the shortest acidic fragment in contrast with the enzyme from S. thermophile, which liberated an aldopentauronic acid. Acidic xylooligosaccharides were separated from the hydrolysate by anion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and the primary structure was determined by 13C NMR spectroscopy. The acidic xylo-oligosaccharides were tested against three Gram-positive and three Gram-negative aerobically grown bacteria, as well as against Helicobacter pylori. Aldopentauronic acid was proved more active against the Gram-positive bacteria and against H. pylori.

14599595	Mode of action of family 10 and 11 endoxylases on water-unextractable arabinoxylan	Microbial endo-beta-1,4-xylases (EXs, EC 3.2.1.8) belonging to glycase families 10 and 11 differ in their action on water-unextractable arabinoxylan (WU-AX). WU-AX was incubated with different levels of a Thermoascus aurantiacus family 10 and a Sporotrichum thermophile family 11 endoxylases. At 10 g l(-1) arabinoxylan, enzyme concentrations (KE values) needed to obtain half-maximal hydrolysis rates (V(max) values) were 4.4 nM for the xylase from T. aurantiacus and 7.1 nM for the xylase from S. thermophile. Determition of Vmax/KE revealed that the family 10 enzyme hydrolysed two times more efficiently WU-AX than the family 11 enzyme. Molecular weights of the products formed were assessed and separation of feruloyl-oligosaccharides was achieved by anion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). The main difference between the feruloylated products by xylases of family 10 and 11 concerned the length of the products containing feruloyl-arabinosyl substitution. The xylase from T. aurantiacus liberated from WU-AX a feruloyl arabinoxylodisaccharide (FAX2) as the shortest feruloylated fragment in contrast with the enzyme from S. thermophile, which liberated a feruloyl arabinoxylotrisaccharide (FAX3). These results indicated that different factors govern WU-AX breakdown by the two endoxylases.

16233470	Enzymic production of aldopentauronic acid and use as a bioregulator in plant airlift bioreactors	Neutral and acidic oligosaccharides were obtained from birchwood xylan by treatment with an endoxylase, family 11 class, from Sporotrichum thermophile. The main acidic xylooligosaccharide (aldopentauronic acid) was separated from the hydrolysate by anion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography and the structure was determined by 13C NMR spectroscopy. The aldopentauronic acid yield was 25% (w/w) of the total solubilized sugars. The addition of purified aldopentauronic acid at a concentration of 5 mg/l to cucumber liquid culture in 2.5-l airlift bioreactors caused in increase in both the number of regenerants and their fresh weight.

12761390	Structure of two fungal beta-1,4-galactases: searching for the basis for temperature and pH optimum	beta-1,4-Galactases hydrolyze the galactan side chains that are part of the complex carbohydrate structure of the pectin. They are assigned to family 53 of the glycoside hydrolases and display significant variations in their pH and temperature optimum and stability. Two fungal beta-1,4-galactases from Myceliophthora thermophila and Humicola insolens have been cloned and heterologously expressed, and the crystal structures of the gene products were determined. The structures are compared to the previously only known family 53 structure of the galactase from Aspergillus aculeatus (AAGAL) showing approximately 56% identity. The M. thermophila and H. insolens galactases are thermophilic enzymes and are most active at neutral to basic pH, whereas AAGAL is mesophilic and most active at acidic pH. The structure of the M. thermophila galactase (MTGAL) was determined from crystals obtained with HEPES and TRIS buffers to 1.88 A and 2.14 A resolution, respectively. The structure of the H. insolens galactase (HIGAL) was determined to 2.55 A resolution. The thermostability of MTGAL and HIGAL correlates with increase in the protein rigidity and electrostatic interactions, stabilization of the alpha-helices, and a tighter packing. An inspection of the active sites in the three enzymes identifies several amino acid substitutions that could explain the variation in pH optimum. Examition of the activity as a function of pH for the D182N mutant of AAGAL and the A90S/ H91D mutant of MTGAL showed that the difference in pH optimum between AAGAL and MTGAL is at least partially associated with differences in the ture of residues at positions 182, 90, and/or 91.

14599353	Colorimetric assays for biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by fungal laccases	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are highly toxic organic pollutants widely distributed in terrestrial and aquatic environments. In the present work, 2 colorimetric assays for laccase-catalyzed degradation of PAHs were developed based on studies of the oxidation of 12 aromatic hydrocarbons by fungal laccases from Trametes versicolor and Myceliophthora thermophila. Using a sodium borohydride water-soluble solution, the authors could reduce the single product of laccase-catalyzed anthracene biooxidation into the orange-colored 9,10-anthrahydroquinone, which is quantifiable spectrophotometrically. An assay using polymeric dye (Poly R-478) as a surrogate substrate for lignin degradation by laccase in the presence of mediator is also presented. The decolorization of Poly R-478 was correlated to the oxidation of PAHs mediated by laccases. This demonstrates that a ligninolytic indicator such as Poly R-478 can be used to screen for PAH-degrading laccases; it will also be useful in screening mutant libraries in directed evolution experiments. Poly R-478 is stable and readily soluble. It has a high extinction coefficient and low toxicity toward white rot fungi, yeast, and bacteria, which allow its application in a solid-phase assay format.

12033819	Formation of bound residues of 8-hydroxybentazon by oxidoreductive catalysts in soil	This study was performed to determine which oxidoreductive catalysts were most efficient in catalyzing the binding of 8-hydroxybentazon to soil humic substances. 8-Hydroxybentazon was completely transformed by an oxidoreductive enzyme, laccase of Myceliophthora thermophila, at pH 3.0-7.0 within 30 min. When abiotic catalysts, manganese(IV), iron(III), and aluminum oxides were used in the same pH range, 8-hydroxybentazon was completely transformed only by manganese(IV) oxide (delta-MnO2), but a relatively small amount of 8-hydroxybentazon was transformed by iron(III) oxide and aluminum oxide. The adsorption of 8-hydroxybentazon in the soil showed an H-type and coincided well with the Langmuir isotherm. To better understand the factors involved in the rapid and strong binding of 8-hydroxybentazon with soil humic substances, 8-hydroxybentazon transformation by oxidoreductive catalysts was studied in various soil conditions: air-dried, preincubated, sterilized, and iron(III) oxide and manganese(IV) oxide free. 8-Hydroxybentazon was completely transformed within 24 h in the decreasing order of preincubated, air-dried, and sterilized soils. However, little transformation was observed in the iron(III) oxide and manganese(IV) oxide free soils. These results suggest that the major catalyst responsible for the rapid and strong binding of 8-hydroxybentazon to soil humic substances is a metal oxide, manganese(IV) oxide, not a soil oxidoreductive enzyme.

12226723	Redox-mediated decolorization of synthetic dyes by fungal laccases	Laccases from the lignin-degrading basidiomycetes Trametes versicolor, Polyporus pinisitus and the ascomycete Myceliophthora thermophila were found to decolorize synthetic dyes to different extents. Differences were attributed to the specific catalytic properties of the individual enzymes and to the structure of the dyes. Due to their higher oxidative capacities, the laccases from the two basidiomycetes decolorized dyes more efficiently than that of the ascomycete. The azo dye Direct Red 28, the indigoid Acid Blue 74 and anthraquinonic dyes were directly enzymatically decolorized within 16 h. The addition of 2 mM of the redox-mediator 1-hydroxybenzotriazole further improved and facilitated the decolorization of all nine dyes investigated. Laccases decolorized dyes both individually and in complex mixtures in the presence of bentonite or immobilized in algite beads. Our data suggest that laccase/mediator systems are effective biocatalysts for the treatment of effluents from textile, dye or printing industries.

12202045	Toxicological studies on Laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila expressed in Aspergillus oryzae	The bioindustrially produced enzyme laccase can be used in different technical and food applications to facilitate processes. It can be added to different oral care products such as mouthwash, toothpaste, mints, and gums to prevent halitosis. Laccase, produced by submerged fermentation of Aspergillus oryzae, containing a gene origiting from Myceliophthora thermophila, was subject to a series of toxicological tests to document its safety in use. It was not found to be mutagenic in the Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation assay, nor did it cause chromosomal aberrations in cultured human lymphocytes. No evidence of inhalation toxicity or skin and eye irritation was found. There was no evidence of possible skin sensitization in a human skin sensitization test when Laccase was tested at 10% (w/v): thus Laccase would appear to have a low skin sensitization potential. Oral administration to rats of up to 10.0 mL/kg body wt/day (equivalent to a total organic solids dosage of 1.72 g/kg body wt/day) for 13 weeks did not cause any adverse effect.

11694062	Dioxygen reactivity of laccase: dependence on laccase source, pH, and anion inhibition	A study was carried out on the dioxygen reactivity of the laccases from Trametes villosa, Rhizoctonia solani, Myceliophthora thermophila, Scytalidium thermophilum, and Coprinus cinereus. At pH 5.5, these laccases showed an apparently constant Km (about 20-50 microM) for O2 with either 2,2'-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) or methyl syringate as the reducing substrate, in contrast to the kcat, which varied up to 100-fold. O2 reactivity of the Trametes and Myceliophthora laccases was also studied at various pH and F concentrations. The apparent Km of Trametes and Myceliophthora laccases varied only slightly when pH changed from 3.0 to 8.0 or when the laccases were inhibited by F- at pH 5.5, although the apparent kcat were more significantly affected by both factors. The dependence of the apparent Km on the source of laccase, pH, and F- inhibition suggested that the fungal laccases might have a conserved O2 pocket and that the F- or OH- inhibition might affect the O2 reduction step (kcat) more than the O2 binding step (Km) under steady-state conditions.

10725534	A critical review of cellobiose dehydrogeses	Cellobiose dehydrogese (CDH) is an extracellular enzyme produced by various wood-degrading fungi. It oxidizes soluble cellodextrins, mannodextrins and lactose efficiently to their corresponding lactones by a ping-pong mechanism using a wide spectrum of electron acceptors including quinones, phenoxyradicals, Fe(3+), Cu(2+) and triiodide ion. Monosaccharides, maltose and molecular oxygen are poor substrates. CDH that adsorbs strongly and specifically to cellulose carries two prosthetic groups; mely, an FAD and a heme in two different domains that can be separated after limited proteolysis. The FAD-containing fragment carries all known catalytic and cellulose binding properties. One-electron acceptors, like ferricyanide, cytochrome c and phenoxy radicals, are, however, reduced more slowly by the FAD-fragment than by the intact enzyme, suggesting that the function of the heme group is to facilitate one-electron transfer. Non-heme forms of CDH have been found in the culture filtrate of some fungi (probably due to the action of fungal proteases) and were for a long time believed to represent a separate enzyme (cellobiose:quinone oxidoreductase, CBQ). The amino acid sequence of CDH has been determined and no significant homology with other proteins was detected for the heme domain. The FAD-domain sequence belongs to the GMC oxidoreductase family that includes, among others, Aspergillus niger glucose oxidase. The homology is most distinct in regions that correspond to the FAD-binding domain in glucose oxidase. A cellulose-binding domain of the fungal type is present in CDH from Myceliophtore thermophila (Sporotrichum thermophile), but in others an interl sequence rich in aromatic amino acid residues has been suggested to be responsible for the cellulose binding. The biological function of CDH is not fully understood, but recent results support a hydroxyl radical-generating mechanism whereby the radical can degrade and modify cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. CDH has found technical use in highly selective amperometric biosensors and several other applications have been suggested.

10328816	Cloning and characterization of a thermostable cellobiose dehydrogese from Sporotrichum thermophile	Cellobiose dehydrogese (CDH) is an extracellular hemoflavoenzyme produced by several wood-degrading fungi. CDH contains one heme b and one FAD per molecule and oxidizes cellobiose to cellobionolactone in the presence of cytochrome c. In this report, a thermostable CDH from the thermophilic ascomycete Sporotrichum thermophile has been purified, cloned, and characterized. The temperature optimum for this CDH reaction was 60 degrees C, and the activation energy for the reaction was 26.3 kJ/mol. The Km and kcat were temperature-dependent and increased as reaction temperature increased. These kinetic properties prove that this CDH is truly thermophilic. A 2.8-kb cD was isolated by screening an expression library of S. thermophile with a polyclol antisera raised against Phanerochaete chrysosporium CDH. The cD encoded an 807-amino-acid protein with a predicted mass of 86,332 Da. S. thermophile CDH is organized into three domains, an N-termil flavin domain, a middle heme domain, and a C-termil cellulose-binding domain, which shows sequence similarity with the cellulose-binding domains of endoglucases and cellobiohydrolases from Trichoderma reesei. Comparison with the CDH sequences of P. chrysosporium and Trametes versicolor identified Met 95 and His 143 as potential heme coorditions. EFIG, LGGPM, and VNSTH motifs in the heme domain and the XRXPXTDXPSXDGXRY motif in the flavin domain were identified as CDH-specific motifs. With regard to the amino acid composition, S. thermophile CDH has more disulfide linkages and acidic and basic amino acids compared to CDHs from P. chrysosporium and T. versicolor.

10347057	Comparison of fungal laccases and redox mediators in oxidation of a nonphenolic lignin model compound	Several fungal laccases have been compared for the oxidation of a nonphenolic lignin dimer, 1-(3, 4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)propan-1,3-diol (I), and a phenolic lignin model compound, phenol red, in the presence of the redox mediators 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (1-HBT) or violuric acid. The oxidation rates of dimer I by the laccases were in the following order: Trametes villosa laccase (TvL) > Pycnoporus cinbarinus laccase (PcL) > Botrytis cinerea laccase (BcL) > Myceliophthora thermophila laccase (MtL) in the presence of either 1-HBT or violuric acid. The order is the same if the laccases are used at the same molar concentration or added to the same activity (with ABTS [2, 2'-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] as a substrate). During the oxidation of dimer I, both 1-HBT and violuric acid were to some extent consumed. Their consumption rates also follow the above order of laccases, i.e., TvL > PcL > BcL > MtL. Violuric acid allowed TvL and PcL to oxidize dimer I much faster than 1-HBT, while BcL and violuric acid oxidized dimer I more slowly than BcL and 1-HBT. The oxidation rate of dimer I is dependent upon both kcat and the stability of the laccase. Both 1-HBT and violuric acid ictivated the laccases, violuric acid to a greater extent than 1-HBT. The presence of dimer I or phenol red in the reaction mixture slowed down this ictivation. The ictivation is mainly due to the reaction of the redox mediator free radical with the laccases. We did not find any relationship between the carbohydrate content of the laccases and their ictivation. When the redox potential of the laccases is in the range of 750 to 800 mV, i.e., above that of the redox mediator, it does not affect kcat and the oxidation rate of dimer I.

9925555	Biochemical characterization of fungal phytases (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate phosphohydrolases): catalytic properties	Supplementation with phytase is an effective way to increase the availability of phosphorus in seed-based animal feed. The biochemical characteristics of an ideal phytase for this application are still largely unknown. To extend the biochemical characterization of wild-type phytases, the catalytic properties of a series of fungal phytases, as well as Escherichia coli phytase, were determined. The specific activities of the fungal phytases at 37 degreesC ranged from 23 to 196 U. (mg of protein)-1, and the pH optima ranged from 2.5 to 7.0. When excess phytase was used, all of the phytases were able to release five phosphate groups of phytic acid (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate), which left myo-inositol 2-monophosphate as the end product. A combition consisting of a phytase and Aspergillus niger pH 2.5 acid phosphatase was able to liberate all six phosphate groups. When substrate specificity was examined, the A. niger, Aspergillus terreus, and E. coli phytases were rather specific for phytic acid. On the other hand, the Aspergillus fumigatus, Emericella nidulans, and Myceliophthora thermophila phytases exhibited considerable activity with a broad range of phosphate compounds, including phenyl phosphate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate, sugar phosphates, alpha- and beta-glycerophosphates, phosphoenolpyruvate, 3-phosphoglycerate, ADP, and ATP. Both phosphate liberation kinetics and a time course experiment in which high-performance liquid chromatography separation of the degradation intermediates was used showed that all of the myo-inositol phosphates from the hexakisphosphate to the bisphosphate were efficiently cleaved by A. fumigatus phytase. In contrast, phosphate liberation by A. niger or A. terreus phytase decreased with incubation time, and the myo-inositol tris- and bisphosphates accumulated, suggesting that these compounds are worse substrates than phytic acid is. To test whether broad substrate specificity may be advantageous for feed application, phosphate liberation kinetics were studied in vitro by using feed suspensions supplemented with 250 or 500 U of either A. fumigatus phytase or A. niger phytase (tuphos) per kg of feed. Initially, phosphate liberation was linear and identical for the two phytases, but considerably more phosphate was liberated by the A. fumigatus phytase than by the A. niger phytase at later stages of incubation.

9925554	Biophysical characterization of fungal phytases (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate phosphohydrolases): molecular size, glycosylation pattern, and engineering of proteolytic resistance	Phytases (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate phosphohydrolases) are found turally in plants and microorganisms, particularly fungi. Interest in these enzymes has been stimulated by the fact that phytase supplements increase the availability of phosphorus in pig and poultry feed and thereby reduce environmental pollution due to excess phosphate excretion in areas where there is intensive livestock production. The wild-type phytases from six different fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Emericella nidulans, Myceliophthora thermophila, and Talaromyces thermophilus, were overexpressed in either filamentous fungi or yeasts and purified, and their biophysical properties were compared with those of a phytase from Escherichia coli. All of the phytases examined are monomeric proteins. While E. coli phytase is a nonglycosylated enzyme, the glycosylation patterns of the fungal phytases proved to be highly variable, differing for individual phytases, for a given phytase produced in different expression systems, and for individual batches of a given phytase produced in a particular expression system. Whereas the extents of glycosylation were moderate when the fungal phytases were expressed in filamentous fungi, they were excessive when the phytases were expressed in yeasts. However, the different extents of glycosylation had no effect on the specific activity, the thermostability, or the refolding properties of individual phytases. When expressed in A. niger, several fungal phytases were susceptible to limited proteolysis by proteases present in the culture supertant. N-termil sequencing of the fragments revealed that cleavage invariably occurred at exposed loops on the surface of the molecule. Site-directed mutagenesis of A. fumigatus and E. nidulans phytases at the cleavage sites yielded mutants that were considerably more resistant to proteolytic attack. Therefore, engineering of exposed surface loops may be a strategy for improving phytase stability during feed processing and in the digestive tract.

9693103	Site-directed mutations in fungal laccase: effect on redox potential, activity and pH profile	A Myceliophthora thermophila laccase and a Rhizoctonia solani laccase were mutated on a pentapeptide segment believed to be near the type-1 Cu site. The mutation L513F in Myceliophthora laccase and the mutation L470F in Rhizoctonia laccase took place at a position corresponding to the type-1 Cu axial methionine (M517) ligand in Zucchini ascorbate oxidase. The triple mutations V509L,S510E,G511A in Myceliophthora laccase and L466V,E467S,A468G in Rhizoctonia laccase involved a sequence segment whose homologue in ascorbate oxidase is flanked by the M517 and a type-1 Cu-ligating histidine (H512). The single mutation did not yield significant changes in the enzymic properties (including any significant increase in the redox potential of the type-1 Cu). In contrast, the triple mutation resulted in several significant changes. In comparison with the wild type, the Rhizoctonia and Myceliophthora laccase triple mutants had a phenol-oxidase activity whose pH optimum shifted 1 unit lower and higher, respectively. Although the redox potentials were not significantly altered, the Km, kcat and fluoride inhibition of the laccases were greatly changed by the mutations. The observed effects are interpreted as possible mutation-induced structural perturbations on the molecular recognition between the reducing substrate and laccase and on the electron transfer from the substrate to the type-1 Cu centre.

9251203	Characterization of the gene encoding an extracellular laccase of Myceliophthora thermophila and alysis of the recombint enzyme expressed in Aspergillus oryzae	A genomic D segment encoding an extracellular laccase was isolated from the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila, and the nucleotide sequence of this gene was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of M. thermophila laccase (MtL) shows homology to laccases from diverse fungal genera. A vector containing the M. thermophila laccase coding region, under transcriptiol control of an Aspergillus oryzae alpha-amylase gene promoter and termitor, was constructed for heterologous expression in A. oryzae. The recombint laccase expressed in A. oryzae was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by anion-exchange chromatography. Amino-termil sequence data suggests that MtL is synthesized as a preproenzyme. The molecular mass was estimated to be approximately 100 to 140 kDa by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 and to be 85 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Carbohydrate alysis revealed that MtL contains 40 to 60% glycosylation. The laccase shows an absorbance spectrum that is typical of blue copper oxidases, with maxima at 276 and 589 nm, and contains 3.9 copper atoms per subunit. With syringaldazine as a substrate, MtL has optimal activity at pH 6.5 and retains nearly 100% of its activity when incubated at 60 degrees C for 20 min. This is the first report of the cloning and heterologous expression of a thermostable laccase.

9025298	The phytase subfamily of histidine acid phosphatases: isolation of genes for two novel phytases from the fungi Aspergillus terreus and Myceliophthora thermophila	Phytases catalyse the hydrolysis of phytate (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate) to myo-inositol and inorganic phosphate. In this study genes encoding novel phytases from two different filamentous fungi, Aspergillus terreus strain 9A-1 and Myceliophthora thermophila were isolated. The encoded PhyA phytase proteins show 60% (A. terreus) and 48% (M. thermophila) identity, respectively, to the PhyA of Aspergillus niger and have 21-29% identity compared to other histidine acid phosphatases. All three PhyA proteins, in contrast to the A. niger pH 2.5-optimum acid phosphatase, prefer phytic acid as substrate and show enzyme activity at a broad range of acidic pH values. Based on their enzyme characteristics and protein sequence homology, the phytases form a novel subclass of the histidine acid phosphatase family.

8597577	A study of a series of recombint fungal laccases and bilirubin oxidase that exhibit significant differences in redox potential, substrate specificity, and stability	A series of fungal laccases (Polyporus pinsitus, Rhizoctonia solani, Myceliophthora thermophila, Scytalidium thermophilum) and one bilirubin oxidase (Myrothecium verrucaria) have been studied to determine their redox potential, specificity, and stability. Polyporus and Rhizoctonia laccases possess potentials near 0.7-0.8 V (vs. NHE), while other oxidases have potentials near 0.5 V. It is observed that higher redox potential correlates with higher activity. By EPR, no significant change in the geometry of type 1 copper (II) site is observed over this series. At the optimal pH, the two substrates studied, 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) and syringaldazine, show Km values ranging form 10 to 120 and from 1 to 45 microM; and kcat values ranging from 50 to 16 000 and 200 to 3000 per min, respectively. The enzymes are more stable in the neutral-alkaline pH range. The thermal stability is in the order of bilirubin oxidase equivalent to Myceliophthora laccase equivalent to Scytalidium laccase > Polyporus laccase > Rhizoctonia laccase. Based on these results and the sequence alignments made against Zucchini ascorbate oxidase it is speculated that structural differences in the substrate-activation site (a 'blue', type 1 copper center) control the redox potential range as well as substrate specificity, and the cystine content contributes to stability.

8938783	Posttraumatic gas-containing brain abscess caused by Clostridium perfringens with unique simultaneous fungal suppuration by Myceliophthora thermophila: case report	OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Gas-containing brain abscesses are rare, and the vast majority are caused by Clostridium perfringens. Significant simultaneous fungal infection in a bacterial abscess is even rarer. We present such a case and review the literature. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 21-month-old male patient sustained a penetrating head injury in a barnyard, developed a gas-containing left parietal brain abscess, and presented with high fever, galeal swelling, and seizure. INTERVENTION: The patient initially underwent debridement of his wound and then repeated aspirations. The initial cultures revealed pure growth of Clostridium perfringens. Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, serial neuroimaging did not demonstrate a decrease in the size of the cavity. An excision had to be undertaken 6 weeks after the injury. The culture from the excised specimen revealed an unexpected growth of a saprophytic and opportunistic fungus, Myceliophthora thermophila. Antifungal treatment consisting of the administration of liposomal amphotericin B and itracozole was then performed. The child was well and neurologically intact 6 months after the excision. CONCLUSION: Our review revealed 38 cases of clostridial brain abscess in the literature. Despite the reputation of the organism, the outcome with clostridial brain abscesses was relatively benign. The main characteristics of clostridial brain abscesses are highlighted, with reference to their optimal treatment. Our review also revealed that fungal infection after a penetrating head injury is extremely rare and often fatal. Our case seems to be the first in the medical literature with growth of M. thermophila as a caUSAtive agent for intracranial suppuration.

24414665	Production of cellulases by thermophilic fungi grown on Leptochloa fusca straw	Seven indigenous thermophilic fungi were screened for cellulase and xylase production when grown on Leptochloa fusca (kallar grass) straw. Aspergillus fumigatus produced the highest activities of 0.4, 2.5, 3.5 and 0.14 U/ml of filter paper cellulase, CM-cellulase, xylase and beta-xylosidase, respectively. Sporotrichum thermophile produced 0.47 beta-glucosidase/ml. Chaetomium thermophile, Humicola grisea and Torula thermophila had lower activities than the other thermophilic fungi.

24421095	Cereal straw and pure cellulose as carbon sources for growth and production of plant cell-wall degrading enzymes by Sporotrichum thermophile	Sporotrichum thermophile grew well and produced plant cell-wall degrading enzymes on straw (barley and wheat) of different particle sizes and Avicel as carbon sources. Comparable activities of endoglucase, Avicelase and cellobiase were produced on each substrate. In contrast, activities of xylase, aryl-beta-glucosidase, beta-xylosidase, esterase and alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase were higher on straw (either wheat or barley) than on Avicel. The enzyme systems produced on barley straw of different particle sizes degraded finely milled barley straw in vitro more rapidly and to a greater extent than those produced on Avicel. In contrast, the enzyme systems produced on Avicel and very coarse barley straw hydrolysed Avicel to about the same extent while that produced on fine barley straw was slightly less effective. The main hydrolysis product in all cases was glucose. Isoelectric focusing revealed that the plant cell-wall degrading enzyme system produced by S. thermophile on barley straw was qualitatively and quantitatively superior to that produced on Avicel.

8448996	Evidence for alpha and Mu class glutathione S-transferases in a number of fungal species	1. The glutathione S-transferases of the following fungal species have been affinity purified on glutathione-Sepharose; Yarrowia lipolytica (NCYC825), Sporotrichum thermophile (ATCC16479), Talaromyces emersonii (ATCC26914) and Issatchenkia orientalis (CBS5147 and an isolate provided by Prof. Kumagai, Kyoto University). 2. SDS-PAGE alysis of affinity purified fungal extracts, followed by Western blots with polyclol antisera to rat GSTs, was performed and indicated the presence of Alpha and Mu class glutathione S-transferases in the fungi immunologically and electrophoretically similar to the rat enzymes. 3. Each extract gave a characteristic affinity-gradient elution pattern on glutathione-agarose.		Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

1452676	Fatal dissemited infection caused by Myceliophthora thermophila, a new agent of mycosis: case history and laboratory characteristics	We report a case of human infection caused by the hyphomycete Myceliophthora thermophila. A 7-year-old male with neurofibromatosis (type 1) was diagnosed in 1987 with acute myeloblastic leukemia associated with the chromosomal abnormality monosomy 7. The patient experienced multiple serious infections over a three-year period before expiring in 1990 while in the end stage of leukemia. Autopsy findings included fungal vegetations of the left atrium, ascending aorta, and pulmory arteries and fungal invasion of both lungs. Cultures yielded M. thermophila. We believe that this is the first reported fatality caused by M. thermophila.

1506028	Induction and regulation of alpha-amylase synthesis in a cellulolytic thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila D14 (ATCC 48104)	The alpha-amylase enzyme synthesis was higher when M. thermophila D-14 (ATCC 48104) was grown in culture medium incorporated with starch or other carbohydrates containing maltose units. Maximum enzyme production was attained with 1% starch followed by a gradual decrease with increasing concentration. Marked decrease in alpha-amylase synthesis occurred with the addition of glucose to the culture medium and this decreasing activity was proportiol to the concentration of glucose. The enzyme synthesis was resumed as soon as the glucose concentration fell below a critical level. The addition of cAMP did not elimite the repressive activity of glucose. The findings suggest that extracellular alpha-amylase synthesis in M. thermophila D-14 was inducible and subject to catabolite repression.

24425278	Purification and characterization of extracellular beta-glucosidase from Myceliophthora thermophila	The extracellular beta-glucosidase has been purified from culture broth of Myceliophthora thermophila ATCC 48104 grown on crystalline cellulose. The enzyme was purified approximately 30-fold by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation and column chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex A-50, Sephadex G-200 and DEAE-Sephadex A-50. The molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated to be about 120 kD by both sodium dodecyl sulphate gel electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography. It displayed optimal activity at pH 4.8 and 60 degrees C. The purified enzyme in the absence of substrate was stable up to 60 degrees C and pH between 4.5 and 5.5. The enzyme hydrolysed p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucoside, cellobiose and salicin but not carboxymethyl cellulose or crystalline cellulose. The K m of the enzyme was 1.6MM for p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucoside and 8.0MM for cellobiose. D-Glucose was a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme with a K of 22.5MM. Enzyme K activity was inhibited by HgCl2, FeSO4, CuSO4, EDTA, sodium dodecyl sulphate, p-chloromercurobenzoate and iodoacetamide and was stimulated by 2-mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol and glutathione. Ethanol up to 1.7 M had no effect on the enzyme activity.		World journal of microbiology & biotechnology			1991	10.1007/BF00452843
1366631	Production of cellulolytic enzymes by immobilized Sporotrichum thermophile	Spores of Sporotrichum thermophile were immobilized in agar, polyacrylamide, and sodium algite to generate in situ mycelium for production of cellulolytic enzymes. Immobilized mycelium was considerably less effective than free cells for cellulase productivity. Of the three gel types, agar beads proved to be the best carrier for the immobilized spores and subsequently generated mycelium. Results of repeated batch experiments suggested that the immobilized mycelia could be reused but at much reduced efficiency.

2269871	Purification and properties of an extracellular endoglucase from Myceliophthora thermophila D-14 (ATCC 48104)	An extracellular endoglucase (1,4-beta-glucanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.4) produced by Myceliophthora thermophila D-14 (ATCC 48104) has been purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulphate precipitation and two consecutive ion-exchange chromatographic steps on DEAE-Sephadex A-50 columns. The enzyme was purified 13.8-fold and was homogeneous by alytical PAGE and SDS-PAGE. It has a high apparent Mr, of about 100,000. The pH and temperature optima for its activity were 4.8 and 65 degrees C respectively. The Km of the purified enzyme for CMC (sodium salt) was 3 mg ml-1. The enzyme displayed low activity toward salicin and p-nitrophenyl beta-D-glucoside. The activity was enhanced in the presence of +, K+ and Ca2+ but effectively inhibited by Hg2+, Fe2+, Mg2+, Cu2+ and NH4+. Inhibition studies indicated that the enzyme may be a metalloprotein and/or that it requires metal ions for its optimum activity.

2793591	Isolation and characterization of new thiol protease inhibitors estatins A and B	New thiol protease inhibitors, estatins A and B, were isolated from the culture filtrate of Myceliophthora thermophila M4323. The basic, water-soluble inhibitors were characterized as having an agmatine, trans-epoxysuccinic acid and L-phenylalanine or L-tyrosine moieties in the structure. The molecular formulas C18H25N5O5 and C18H25N5O6 for A and B were indicated by elemental alysis and fast atom bombardment MS. Estatins were specific inhibitors against thiol proteases such as papain, ficin and bromelain. They suppressed IgE antibody production in mice, but not IgG.

16347725	Induction and Catabolite Repression of beta-Glucosidase Synthesis in Myceliophthora thermophila D-14 (= ATCC 48104)	beta-Glucosidase activity in Myceliophthora thermophila D-14 (= ATCC 48104) was inducible and was produced in culture filtrate during growth with various inducers, of which PNPG (p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucoside) was the most efficient. Induction of beta-glucosidase also occurred when the organism was grown in medium supplemented with different carbon sources. Carboxymethyl cellulose, cellobiose, and Solka-Floc were found effective for induction of enzyme biosynthesis. The addition of glucose to the culture medium severely repressed beta-glucosidase synthesis, which could not be reversed by exogenous cyclic AMP or dibutyryl cyclic AMP.

16347439	Sporotrichum thermophile Growth, Cellulose Degradation, and Cellulase Activity	The activity of components of the extracellular cellulase system of the thermophilic fungus Sporotrichum thermophile showed appreciable differences between strains; beta-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21) was the most variable component. Although its endoglucase (EC 3.2.1.4) and exoglucase (EC 3.2.1.91) activities were markedly lower, S. thermophile degraded cellulose faster than Trichoderma reesei. The production of beta-glucosidase lagged behind that of endoglucase and exoglucase. The latter activities were produced during active growth. When growth was inhibited by cycloheximide treatment, the hydrolysis of cellulose was lower than in the control in spite of the presence of both endoglucase and exoglucase activities in the culture medium. Degradation of cellulose was a growth-associated process, with cellulase preparations hydrolyzing cellulose only to a limited extent. The growth rate and cell density of S. thermophile were similar in media containing cellulose or glucose. A distinctive feature of fungal development in media incorporating cellulose or lactose (inducers of cellulase activity) was the rapid differentiation of reproductive units and autolysis of hyphal cells to liberate propagules which were capable of renewing growth immediately.

489257	Comparative temperature-stability properties of malate dehydrogeses from some thermophilic fungi	Temperature-activity and temperature-stability relationships of malate dehydrogeses from eight thermophilic fungi were determined. Temperature optima for maximum activity of the enzymes varied between 50 degrees and 60 degrees and the Arrhenius plots were linear between 5 degrees and 50 degrees. The energies of activation ranged from 2.1 Kcal/mol for the enzyme from Sporotrichum thermophile to 9.1 Kcal/mol for that from Penicillium duponti. Heat ictivation kinetics at 50 degrees revealed heat lability of the enzyme from most of the thermophilic fungi. The t1/2's (min) were less than 10 for the enzymes from P. duponti, S. thermophile and Thermoascus aurantiacus; less than 30 for those from Chaetomium thermophile var. coprophile, H. lanuginosa and C. thermophile var. dissitum; and greater than 30 for those from Mucor pusillus and H. insolens. Salts of +, K+ and NH4+, and citrate protected the enzymes from H. lanuginosa, C. thermophile var. dissitum and M. pusillus against heat ictivation.

697502	Stimulation of growth and glucose catabolite enzymes by succite in some thermophilic fungi	Thermophilic Humicola lanuginosa, Penicillium duponti, Sporotrichum thermophile and Mucor pusillus required succite in addition to glucose for optimal growth. The requirement for succite was concentration-dependent and the concentration needed for one half of the maximal growth was 6.14mM. In the presence of succite, glucose utilization from the medium was markedly increased and this was associated with increased levels of the enzymes of the glycolytic and Krebs cycle pathways. Addition of succite to cultures growing in glucose at any stage of growth stimulated the growth with the resulting rate of growth remaining high if the addition was made within 3 days of inoculation. Cycloheximide (71.4 micrometer) prevented the succite-mediated derepression of the enzymes suggesting that succite may remove the catabolite repression in the presence of glucose.

7194	Factors influencing the production of cellulases by Sporotrichum thermophile	Cellulase production and growth of a strain of Sporotrichum thermophile were studied by using a mineral salts medium supplemented with yeast extract and insoluble cellulose. The effects of cultural conditions, such as pH, nitrogen source, substrate concentration, and temperature, were examined. Maximum production of C1 and CX cellulases occurred at 45 C in 2 to 4 days, in the presence of 1% Solka/Floc as substrate, when NO3 or urea used as sources of nitrogen. Under these conditions, cellulolytic activity of culture filtrates appeared to be similar to that reported for Trichoderma viride grown in a favorable environment. However, comparable yields of cellulase were produced by S. thermophile in less than one-quarter the time required by mesophilic fungi.

16350026	Studies on thermophilic cellulolytic fungi	Three thermophilic cellulolytic fungi, Chaetomium thermophile var. coprophile, Sporotrichum thermophile, and Thermoascus aurantiacus were studied to determine the conditions for a high rate of cellulose degradation. The range of temperature over which good growth occurred was determined first in a temperature gradient incubator; the optimum temperature was then established in shake flask cultures. T. aurantiacus had the highest optimum growth temperature range (46 to 51 C), whereas S. thermophile had the broadest range over which good growth occurred (36 to 43 C). Optimum temperatures for the three organisms, T. aurantiacus, S. Thermophile, and C. thermophile were 48, 40, and 40 C, respectively. It was found that the addition of an organic carbon and nitrogen source to a cellulose mineral solution medium markedly increased the rate of cellulose degradation. The surfactant, Tween 80, which has been reported to be of value in the production and recovery of the enzyme, cellulase, was shown to be detrimental to the degradation of cellulose in culture. In the medium used, S. thermophile gave the highest rate of substrate utilization; 56% of the cellulose was hydrolyzed in 72 h. The average degree of polymerization of cellulose decreased from 745 to 575.
